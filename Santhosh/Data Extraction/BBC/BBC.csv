Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,[],None,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said

A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman.

Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man.

Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues.

The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog.

Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash.

'Shocking case'

He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire.

An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said.

She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station.

Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake.

The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol.""

But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since.

""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said.

Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months.

""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said.

She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling.

If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate.

""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it received a complaint about the remarks attributed to the judge.

Running changed former British soldier's life,Gary Edwards wants to inspire others and helped set up a weekly free 5km running event.,[],None,"Image copyright Great Run Local Image caption Gary Edwards said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done""

A former soldier who turned to alcohol, piled on the pounds and then shed 12 stone (76kg) has said he wants to inspire others to take up running.

Gary Edwards, 52, was medically discharged from the Army after a truck crash in Germany in 1992.

He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his weight increased to 25 stone (159kg).

He used running to get his life ""back on track"" and has helped set up a new fun run at Alton Water, in Suffolk.

Mr Edwards had served in the Royal Corps of Signals for 10 years when the crash happened, which left him with crush injuries to his legs and abdomen, which required part of his intestine to be removed.

Shortly after losing his military career, his son Christopher died from a brain haemorrhage.

He said he ""fell apart mentally and physically"" and turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"".

Image copyright Family Photo Image caption Mr Edwards said he turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"" and saw his weight grow to 25 stone

Mr Edwards, who has two daughters, attended an alcoholics anonymous meeting six years ago, decided his life had to change and he started running.

He said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done"".

Following a trial period at Holbrook Academy, Mr Edwards, of Shotley Gate near Ipswich, has now helped to set up and lead the new free 5km (3.1-mile) Great Run Local Alton Water.

He said: ""Quitting the booze also meant that I started losing weight.

""I was now wanting to get fitter and healthier and to become the man, the dad and the husband I wanted to be.""

Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.

NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference.

One student said the help she received turned her life around.

Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge.

At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course.

She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly.

""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions.""

""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts.""

The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less.

However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up.

""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA.

""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Image caption The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff University's student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking.

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.","['president', 'wasnt', 'younger', 'meetings', 'aa', 'universitys', 'really', 'anonymous', 'university', 'alcoholics', 'wales', 'student', 'needs']","Image copyright Getty ImagesAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

The many groups that have copied Alcoholics Anonymous,Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion.,[],None,"Image copyright Other Image caption An AA meeting depicted on the Sopranos

Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker.

""My name is Peter and I'm an alcoholic.""

It's a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastle's main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison.

Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts.

Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasn't tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous.

All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.""

The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group.

Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA

The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latter's last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps.

Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone.

According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA.

THE 12 STEPS

We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable

Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves

Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs

Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character

Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings

Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all

Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others

Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out

Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs

These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous.

Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for one's needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous.

On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if there's no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute.

Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone.

""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England.

The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety.

""I think there's a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living.""

Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards

Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where you'll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and you'll say the same words: ""My name is… and I'm addicted to …""

""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes.

""They modify the language, but it's the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them.""

The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AA's efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction.

In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide.

Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone.

Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober.""

These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisation's copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps.

And AA's principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. There's also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members.

But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results.

""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous' success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach's efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since.""

Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases.

Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.

But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem.""

That's something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters.

""When I'd been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""There's something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying.""

""It's a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which can't be said for a lot of rehab philosophies.""

In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes.

One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Jay-Z and Meek Mill pledge $50m to free prisoners,"The rappers aim to free one million people who they say are ""trapped in the system"".",[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jay-Z and Meek Mill have partnered with the owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, among others, to launch the Reform Alliance

Jay-Z, Meek Mill and sport and business leaders have pledged $50m (£38m) to reform the US criminal justice system.

The Reform Alliance, which was inspired by Meek Mill's recent stint in prison for a minor probation violation, hopes to free one million prisoners in five years.

The owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, Robert Kraft and Michael Rubin, are co-founders.

Reform says it wants to help people who are ""trapped in the system"".

The group's ""mission"" is to ""dramatically reduce the number of people who are unjustly under the control of the criminal justice system, starting with probation and parole"".

""To win, we will leverage our considerable resources to change laws, policies, hearts and minds,"" it says.

More than six million people can currently count themselves as part of the ""correctional population"" of the USA - which includes people in prisons and local jails, but is mostly made up of the more than four million people on probation or parole, according to Bureau of Justice statistics.

Probation is often given as a sentence instead of time in prison and can include conditions like being on a curfew or going to rehab.

Parole is when an inmate is released early from prison with similar conditions to probation.

Meek Mill has experienced all three: probation, parole and jail.

The Reform Alliance says his case is an example of the ""devastating and long-lasting effects"" that can occur after one interaction with the criminal justice system.

The rapper was arrested in 2007 - he says wrongfully - for drug and gun charges, aged 19.

He was sentenced in 2009 to between 11 and 23 months in county prison, but was released on parole after five months and put on house arrest.

It was during this time he started to make his name nationally as a rapper, signing to Rick Ross's label and releasing a string of hugely successful mixtapes.

Before long he was a platinum-selling artist.

But a parole violation for suspected cannabis use resulted in a ban on touring, and then after failing to get his travel plans approved by the court Meek was sentenced to prison again in 2014.

Examples of parole violations that can land people back in prison range from being late to appointments with parole officers or missing a curfew, to things more specific to the crime that was committed - like failing to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""When you talk about these so-called technical violations, it's not technical to the kid who can never see her mum again because she showed up late for a meeting. That's not technical, that's devastating for that individual child,"" Reform Alliance CEO Van Jones said.

Violations over the next few years resulted in his probation period being extended - it now lasts up until 2023 - as well as the five months in prison which ended in April 2018 and birthed the #FreeMeek movement.

It's people with a similar story to Meek's, that have been ""caught up on probation and parole"", that Reform says it wants to focus on first.

'If someone commits a crime they should go to jail'

""Being from the environment I'm from, I don't even think it's possible for you to be an angel,"" Meek said as the organisation was announced in New York.

""You grow up around murder on a daily basis, you grow up in drug-infested neighbourhoods.

""And every time I started to further my life with the music industry, there was always something that brought me back to ground zero,"" he said.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who attended the event, said he was a supporter of criminal justice reforms that are ""fair, help our system work better and smarter, and save crucial taxpayer dollars while balancing public safety and victim concerns"".

Across the US, roughly a third of people on parole are black, according to Bureau of Justice statistics - something Jay-Z raised at the event.

""We want to be very clear. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail. But these things are just disproportionate and the whole world knows it,"" he said.

Jay-Z has been vocal about Meek's case, writing in the New York Times while he was imprisoned.

""On the surface, this may look like the story of yet another criminal rapper who didn't smarten up and is back where he started,"" he wrote.

""What's happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day.

""I saw this up close when I was growing up in Brooklyn during the 1970s and 1980s. Instead of a second chance, probation ends up being a land mine, with a random misstep bringing consequences greater than the crime. A person on probation can end up in jail over a technical violation like missing a curfew.""

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?","['Finlo Rohrer', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?

David looks, in a word, respectable.

Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man.

He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures.

Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12.

Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death.

Easy eloquence

There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows.

But he has an easy eloquence.

""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says.

People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery

""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now.""

The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA.

One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his son's troubles with the law.

It's impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps.

'Higher power'

Certain lines provoke laughter in the group.

""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasn't a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough.""

Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founder's last drink

There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work.

A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka.

A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk.""

Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years.

And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W.

Fictional depictions

The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives.

And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group.

The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic

Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""I'm X and I'm an alcoholic"".

The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about.

Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"".

Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic.

But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment.

""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics.""

People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but it's hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA.

The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room.""

And those other people are the key, one woman admits.

""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked.

""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

"""Alcoholics Anonymous helped me""",,['Claire Bailey'],2009-10-22 09:44:44,"By Claire Bailey

BBC Wiltshire

Alcoholics Anonymous is a self-funding organisation 'Lil' is in her early forties, she's friendly, polite, intelligent and when her children are ready, she'd love to have them back. ""I never left them, I never intended to leave them, but now I will wait until they are able to give me more time"". I met her at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Swindon. She was one of six women in a group of 20. According to Wiltshire's AA spokesman, 40% of those now attending meetings are women, compared to 10% eight years ago. Lil (not her real name) agreed to share her story in the hope that it might help someone else in her position. She was married, her husband had a good job, she had a good job, she has children aged between 12 and 21, although she lives alone now. Too late She said: ""I lost myself most importantly, because without yourself you really can't give anything to anybody else. ""I ultimately lost my marriage, my children, my job, so there's not much more that I could say that I lost."" She started drinking in her twenties, socially, or after work. It was only in her thirties that her drinking pattern changed. ""I didn't realise I was dependant until it was too late. ""It was more in the evenings and the fact that it was secretively done. It would be a bottle or two of wine a night and it was very much with my family around. I took solace in alcohol until it got to a point where I couldn't stop

Lil* ""There's a lot you can do to disguise alcohol if you feel you need to. ""Having a cup of coffee but having half of it full of whisky is one way to do it, especially when you're making it for yourself."" Lil realised she had a problem about nine years ago. ""I felt that I couldn't cope with life, I knew that I was turning to alcohol to get through the day, and to deal with what I felt were life's problems,"" she said. ""I chose alcohol not realising that it would have a long term affect on me, that it would actually take away more than what I was actually going through. ""That was coupled with a very high profile job, and the stresses that went with that and not feeling that there was ever an end, to sit down and put my feet up. ""I took solace in alcohol until it got to a point where I couldn't stop."" Problem halved It was at this point that Lil went to Alcoholics Anonymous and she says that the support they give her is invaluable. ""Just knowing that there are other people out there like me. ""People are so willing to just listen to your troubles, share what they've been through, and be there for you."" ""Coming to AA means that you don't really need to disclose anything about yourself, nobody's going to point fingers at you, and they are only going to listen and try and help you as much as they can."" It's often said that a problem shared, is a problem halved, and in Wiltshire, meetings on average attract between 15 and 40 people. At the Sunday meeting I went to, in a council run community hall, there were 20 people, six of whom were women, all of whom were welcoming and not at all judgemental. No embarrassment There were kisses and handshakes from people I'd never met, and that, I was led to believe was the welcome you'd get whoever you were, whatever your reasons were for being there. What followed was a 'share', where one person shares their life story, how they got into alcohol and how they are managing to stay away from it now. It was extremely honest, but with no sense of bravado or pride. After 25 minutes came the 'share back', a chance for anyone who could relate to the story, or who had something else to share, could open up and tell their tale. Again, there was honesty and thanks, as well as tears, but no one seemed to judge, and there seemed to be no embarrassment. People were talking with the kind of openness usually reserved for a husband or wife, or a mother or father. Of course in many cases, just like Lil's, those relationships don't exist anymore and there is no one else to talk to. There are over 50 AA groups serving the people of Wiltshire.

Sir Anthony Hopkins opens up on alcohol battle,"The Oscar-winning star says he was ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while drinking.",[],None,"Image copyright Greg Doherty / Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony Hopkins shared advice with students at the University Of California

Sir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

The Oscar-winning star admitted he was ""very difficult to work with"" early in his stage career because he ""was usually hungover"".

He said he turned his life around following a talk with a woman from Alcoholics Anonymous in 1975.

Sir Anthony, 80, was born in Port Talbot but now lives in Los Angeles.

Speaking to about 500 students at the University Of California, the Silence Of The Lambs star discussed his problems with alcohol and the impact it had on his early career.

He said: ""Because that's what you do in theatre, you drink. But I was very difficult to work with, as well, because I was usually hungover.""

Sir Anthony added he had been ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while he was drinking.

The actor told how he started to change following the talk with the Alcoholics Anonymous woman, who asked him ""why don't you just trust in God?"".

From then on the urge to drink was ""never to return"", he added.

Sir Anthony, who was knighted in 1993 for services to the arts, said he got into acting ""because he had nothing better to do"", adding he was ""not at all bright"" in school and was often bullied.

""I believe that we are capable of so much,"" he told the students at the 11th annual Leap, Leadership, Excellence and Accelerating Your Potential conference.

""From my own life, I still cannot believe that my life is what it is because I should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that.""

He now lives in Malibu with his actress wife, Stella Arroyave, and advised students to ""say yes to everything. Say yes and take the risk"".

Sir Anthony is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest living actors and is perhaps best known for his portrayal of cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in 1991's The Silence Of The Lambs, its sequel Hannibal and prequel Red Dragon.","['opens', 'hopkins', 'students', 'wales', 'battle', 'life', 'woman', 'alcohol', 'usually', 'work', 'anthony', 'yes', 'sir', 'early', 'image']","Image copyright Greg Doherty / Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony Hopkins shared advice with students at the University Of CaliforniaSir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

Eminem celebrates a decade of being sober,The rapper has been clean since the end of 2007.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Eminem has revealed he's been sober for ten years.

On Saturday, in between headlining Coachella, he posted a photo of himself with an Alcoholics Anonymous coin which signifies sobriety.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" the rapper wrote on Instagram - which received more than 1.6 million likes.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, was addicted to prescription medication and nearly died of an accidental methadone overdose in 2007.

At the height of his addiction the rapper was reportedly taking up to 20 pills a day.

The 8 Mile actor credits his children for helping him recover and previously revealed he replaced addiction with exercise.

The 45-year-old said running and working out was key to giving him endorphins, which also meant he managed to sleep.

People tweeted him messages of congratulations, including rapper Royce Da 59.

Other people shared their stories of addiction recovery and pictures of their AA coins.

What is an Alcoholics Anonymous coin?

Also known as AA tokens, recovery medallions, sobriety coins or 24 hour chips - they are given out in the US to people during their journey to overcoming addictions.

They bear the circle and triangle symbol used by Alcoholics Anonymous with the words ""unity"", ""service"" and ""recovery"".

On the one Eminem posted on Instagram, the token has the Roman numeral 'X' in the centre of a triangle - which represents 10 years of being sober.

Play centre founder admits filming girls in changing rooms,"Married father-of-two Darren Johnson ""stalked"" girls changing after swimming lessons.",[],None,"Image copyright Metropolitan Police/PA Wire Image caption Married father-of-two Darren Johnson filmed girls getting changed after swimming lessons

The co-founder of a children's play centre filmed youngsters undressing after swimming lessons, a court heard.

Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

The number of victims is not known, but a police officer involved in the case estimated it may be as many as 40.

Johnson, 51, from Putney, south-west London, admitted five counts of voyeurism over a 12-year period.

He was caught when two 14-year-old girls spotted his camera-phone from under the cubicle adjacent to them and alerted staff, Kingston Crown Court heard.

'Stalked children'

After Johnson was identified in CCTV footage, police seized two computers containing hundreds of images of women in various states of undress.

Johnson admitted voyeurism between 1 January 2005 and 5 June 2017.

Two of the charges relate to filming the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at a leisure centre.

Two more charges relate to images of women taken through ""peepholes"" in toilets and changing rooms at an Eddie Catz soft play centre.

His defence lawyer claimed Johnson had not meant to film teenagers.

However, prosecutor Lauren Sales said CCTV shows Johnson ""stalking children around the leisure centre"".

""He attended the leisure centre at times when schools have swim classes,"" she added.

""He goes up to the swimming pool, sees the kids, sees them using the facilities, stalks them to the shower area... and uses the cubicle next to them.""

Image copyright Google Image caption Johnson founded the children's soft play centre company, Eddie Catz, with his wife

Johnson, who founded Eddie Catz with his wife, resigned from the business as soon as the allegations came to light.

The company has centres in Earlsfield, Putney, Wimbledon and Newbury, as well as a presence in branches of Mothercare in Leeds, Gateshead, Manchester, Solihull and Bristol.

Defence lawyer Tom Williams said Johnson was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles.

""He is truly sorry for what he has done and has done everything he can to address those things in his life which pushed him into an extremely dark place in that period,"" Mr Williams said.

Johnson has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and classes for sex addicts since his arrest, the court heard.

Judge Andrew Campbell said Johnson would be sentenced on Wednesday.","['catz', 'centre', 'play', 'johnson', 'founder', 'changing', 'eddie', 'swimming', 'filming', 'girls', 'admits', 'leisure', 'women', 'images', 'rooms']","Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

UK Punjabi alcohol support services 'see rise in users',The reports follow a BBC survey suggesting 27% of British Sikhs have a family member with a problem.,"['Anusha Kumar', 'Aidan Castelli', 'Ed Lowther', 'Bbc Digital Pilots']",None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem.

They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers.

Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest.

Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand.

The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase.

Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue.

The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said.

Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber.

""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up.

""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories.

""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'""

The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue.

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

""To overcome any fear of shame, it's important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

Ant McPartlin has thanked fans for their support after revealing doctors warned he could have died from his painkiller and alcohol addictions.

In a Twitter post, Ant wrote that he was ""overwhelmed"" by the positive feedback he had received.

The star has received more than 2,000 tweets in response to his message.

Ant entered rehab in June, having become addicted to alcohol and prescription painkillers following a knee operation in 2015.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ant and Dec have been friends and TV partners since the early 1990s when they met on TV series Byker Grove

The Bafta-winning star of shows including Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! spoke to The Sun on Sunday after spending two months in rehab.

He said his wife Lisa and TV partner and friend Declan Donnelly had encouraged him to seek help.

""I was at the point where anything - prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs - I would take,"" he said.

""And take them with alcohol, which is ridiculous. The doctors told me, 'You could have killed yourself'.""

He told the newspaper that Dec got involved earlier this year after he delayed a second knee operation so he could carry on working on ITV show Britain's Got Talent.

After undergoing surgery following the show's final, McPartlin said he was ""just done"" and after an hour-long chat with Dec, he entered a rehab clinic.

The star is now clean from both prescription drugs and alcohol.

""My name is JC and I am a workaholic.""

JC, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, says she needed a lot of courage the first time she stood up and said that in front of a group of people she had never met before.

JC, who doesn't want us to reveal her full name, had gone along to a meeting of Workaholics Anonymous because she felt she couldn't cope anymore.

A 40-year-old healthcare worker, who had conquered her alcoholism and an eating disorder, she says she couldn't experience the serenity that she hoped sobriety would bring because she instead had become addicted to working.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For many people securing a decent work/life balance is a tricky business

""I was constantly obsessed with work,"" she says. ""I realised I used work to numb out and avoid myself, my feelings and my fears.""

Her work addiction and the stress that came with it affected her health.

""I had premature grey hair within three months of starting a management position,"" she says. ""I experienced adrenal fatigue... I have a heart condition.""

Following a similar 12-step recovery plan to the one first devised by Alcoholics Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous started in the US in the early 1980s.

Today there are more than 100 meeting groups around the world, from Argentina to the US, the UK and Japan. There is also the possibility of joining an online meeting via Skype or over the phone.

But how do you know if you are a workaholic? And what other ways are there to get help?

Wilmar Schaufeli, a professor of work and organisational psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, describes a workaholic as ""a person who works obsessively hard in a compulsive way"".

Image copyright Jord Visser Image caption Wilmar Schaufeli says that Workaholics Anonymous works for many suffers, because they can realise they are not alone

""So it's a combination between excessive work and compulsive work, compulsive tendency.""

He adds that going to Workaholics Anonymous works for many sufferers because ""you see people who have the same problem, so you are not alone. I think this is an important thing for all kinds of behavioural problems or addictions.""

For other people with work addiction problems, having one-to-one therapy with a trained professional might be the answer.

But what actually can lead to work addition?

Dr Claudia Herbert, a clinical psychologist at the Oxford Development Centre, in Putney, Oxfordshire, often treats sufferers. She says that many workaholics have other mental health disorders.

""Lots of clients may feel depressed, they may actually think that life is a little bit empty, they may have anxiety problems, they may also have addictions to cope with.""

Image copyright Claudia Herbert Image caption Claudia Herbert says that many workaholics have other mental health problems

The condition can be triggered by someone having to work too hard in the first place. ""People often have to take jobs that in previous times would have been done by two or three people,"" she says.

Work addiction may be caused in part by a person being pushed too hard by his or her parents in their earlier life. ""People who as children were reinforced by their achievements rather than who they are, they are more likely to become work addicted,"" she adds.

When it comes to the types of jobs where people are more vulnerable to becoming workaholics, Prof Schaufeli says it is more a case of senior professionals rather than those with jobs on the lower rungs of the workplace ladder.

He says that self-employed people are also vulnerable because they can become obsessed by their businesses.

Prof Schaufeli adds that work addicts very often don't see that their behaviour is problematic because the fact they are doing vast amounts of work often means they are earning more and being promoted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some workaholics are not said to recognise that anything is wrong because they have secured promotions and pay rises

When it comes to treating work addiction, Dr Herbert says it needs to be individually tailored to each sufferer, and getting to the bottom of what caused it.

At Retreat South, a rehabilitation centre and mental health retreat in the Australian state of Victoria, they run a work-related stress and executive burnout programme, trying to get people's work/life balance back.

The programme started six years ago, and the average length of stay is one month, with prices from 8,000 Australian dollars ($6,100; £4,400) per week.

Most of the clients are Australian, but they also have some from Asia and Europe.

""We work on the guilt - I haven't been a good parent, I haven't been a good partner,"" says Jane Enter, Retreat South's clinical director.

Back in Florida, JC - who first went to Workaholics Anonymous back in 2012 - now volunteers for the organisation.

People undergoing detox for alcohol or drug addiction are being put at risk by residential clinics in England - as a lot of the care provided is not safe or good quality, the regulator has found.

The Care Quality Commission based its findings on inspections of the 68 independent services over two years.

Nearly three-quarters were found to be failing in at least one of the fundamental standards of care.

The regulator said detoxification can be ""difficult, unpleasant and risky"".

Last year more than 2,600 people underwent medical detox in a residential rehabilitation service in England - about 1% of the total number being treated for drug and alcohol addiction.

Lasting around five to 10 days, detox can involve fits and hallucinations, as well as a risk of suicide or painkiller drug overdose.

Given this, Dr Paul Lelliott, from the CQC, said he was ""deeply concerned"" because many of the providers of these services in England are not following national clinical guidelines.

Safe care and treatment was where the most breaches were found, with 63% of clinics not meeting this standard when they were first inspected.

Staff were also handling medications incorrectly, administering drugs such as methadone and paracetamol without the right training or too often.

Many clinics were also not assessing safety risks before patients were admitted or following national guidance on how to treat people in withdrawal.

For example, in at least one case, the CQC found staff didn't plan how they would manage a person's epileptic fits during their withdrawal, despite knowing they were at risk of having seizures.

Many staff were also not given full employment checks or sufficient training.

Dr Lelliott said: ""While we have found some services that are providing good care and we are beginning to see improvements, all providers need to review their practice so that we can be assured that they are delivering safe and effective care.

""Detoxification under clinical supervision is often the first stage of a person's addiction treatment. It can be a difficult, unpleasant and sometimes, risky experience. It is vital that providers get this right to support people's onward rehabilitation and recovery.""

Four of the services are no longer operating.

Getting recovery on track

Rosanna O'Connor, at Public Health England, said: ""While residential detox makes up a small part of the overall treatment system, seeing about 1% of all in treatment, they do have a vital role.

""It's crucial these services are in line with best practice, as the clinical guidelines on drug treatment clearly set out.

""This helps ensure not only safety but gives some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the best chance of getting their recovery on track.""

The CQC now plans to rate the other independent services that treat people for substance misuse.

Prof Colin Drummond, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the report ""shows systemic failings in the way these services are provided and that people undergoing detoxification are being exposed to unnecessary risks"".

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough',Two sex addicts speak about the impact it has had on their lives.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship

Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives.

""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough.""

Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship.

Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex.

""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire.

""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it.

""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again.

""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people.""

Image copyright Rebecca Barker Image caption Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction

Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple.

""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from.

""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him.""

In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother.

""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that.

""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything.""

Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France.

""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said.

What is sex addiction?

Relate defines sexual addiction as any sexual activity that feels ""out of control"".

The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170

A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male

The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55

The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019

The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex and points to Relate for further help

Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"".

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy.

""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved

Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw.

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day.

""You have one affair and then you want another and another one.

""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week.

""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again.""

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.

""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'.

""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace.

""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are.

""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle.""

Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private.

""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it.

""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems.

""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,"['Anusha Kumar', 'Aidan Castelli', 'Chayya Syal', 'Bbc Digital Pilots']",None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.

Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room.

The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her.

Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says.

So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps.

There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique.

A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community.

More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool:

Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking.

The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated.

Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness.""

Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped.

By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem.

Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous.

""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone.""

When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families.

The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions.

Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services.

For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help.

She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal.

Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having.

""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?""

The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham.

Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband.

Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home.

But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on.""

Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him.

""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen.""

Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed.

Jail for trucker caught almost six times drink drive limit,A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit is jailed for four months.,[],None,"Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving conviction

A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

A court was told motorists contacted police to report James Gallagher's white Scania being driven erratically on the M80.

Gallagher, 49, was stopped by officers near Pirnhall Services, Stirling and found to be smelling strongly of alcohol.

He was also banned from driving for three years at Stirling Sheriff Court.

The court was told that Gallagher was stopped by police at 14:25 and, despite having had his last drink the previous night, was still 5.95 times the legal limit.

Gallagher, of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, pleaded guilty to drink driving, and confessed to a social worker who prepared a background report that he would routinely drive his tipper truck with the same amount of alcohol in his body.

Previous conviction

The court heard he had a previous conviction for drink-driving in 1998, when he was banned for 14 months.

James McLean, defending, said his client was ashamed of his actions, and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He asked the court not to jail Gallagher, but to impose a community sentence instead.

Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Gallagher: ""You were nearly six times the limit, and that is a significant figure from the point of view of the level of impairment.

""What is of equal concern is that you were driving an HGV, a 12-tonne tipper lorry, and you had been doing it all day, and it is clear that this alcohol level arose from alcohol you had drunk the previous evening.

""These are huge aggravations for a serious offence, and in these circumstances there is no sentence other than a custodial sentence that is appropriate.""","['drink', 'court', 'sentence', 'caught', 'trucker', 'drive', 'gallagher', 'times', 'driving', 'alcohol', 'jail', 'told', 'stirling', 'previous', 'limit']","Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving convictionA man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Briege O'Hara, 61, from Antrim Road, Belfast, was jailed for nine months on Monday.

She was driving on the wrong side of the road on 27 August 2013, when she hit another motorist and injured him.

The court was told that she knew the man whom she injured and was ""entirely remorseful"".

A prosecuting lawyer said the crash happened at 11:30 BST on the Antrim Road.

O'Hara had driven around a bend on the wrong side of the road and the van ""didn't have a chance"" to move out of her way.

She was arrested and tests showed she had been driving whilst over the limit.

O'Hara said she could not remember the crash. She said she had taken a glass of wine and 5mgs of Diazepam before leaving the house.

She pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving and also driving with excess alcohol.

The van driver, a man in his mid 60s, broke his sternum and left hand in the collision and lost his job as a delivery driver as a result. He was treated in hospital for his injuries.

A defence lawyer said that while the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"", his client was ""entirely remorseful"".

He said that she had spent 12 weeks in residential care for alcohol addiction problems almost immediately after causing the crash and had not taken alcohol since then.

Her lawyer said she had had a very difficult life and was emotionally fragile.

O'Hara was sentenced to 18 months. She will spend half of this time in prison, with the remaining nine months spent on supervised licence. She was also banned from driving for three years.","['drink', 'months', 'crash', 'way', 'wrong', 'whilst', 'lawyer', 'belfast', 'woman', 'driving', 'jailed', 'van', 'court', 'road']","Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meetingA woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Scheme to tackle A&E violence introduced in Glasgow,"A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, is operating in Glasgow.",[],None,"Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit

A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

The Navigators Scheme, funded by Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, has been operating at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) since December.

It involves two navigators establishing a connection with people who are victims or perpetrators of violence.

They later discuss the agencies and services that can help them.

This could include relationship counselling or putting them in touch with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Shelter.

The Navigator scheme is the first to be available for anyone being treated in an accident and emergency department.

But a charity in London called Redthread has been running hospital-based violence intervention programmes specifically for young people for the past 11 years

'No violent o'clock'

Doctors at the GRI said the project was one of the most important innovations they had seen in decades.

They hope the scheme can be rolled out to A&E departments across Scotland.

Senior consultant, Donogh Maguire, said it was possibly the most valuable non-medical change in the management of A&E in the whole course of his career.

Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit Image caption Navigators Tam Begbie and Alan Gilmour have been working at the hospital since December

""I think for inner-city hospitals, this should be a standard means of engaging with the homeless and disenfranchised people that we have coming to our departments,"" he said.

""The reason I say this is because the current mechanisms are failing or the people are not engaging with them, whereas here we're getting the navigators catching people at a time when they're amenable to some intervention.""

One of the navigators, Alan Gilmour, said the work was highly unpredictable.

""We don't know what's coming in, we don't know what's happening,"" he said.

""I mean, there's no 'violent o'clock'. We begin our shift and we just wait or find out if there's anyone in and if there's not we wait around for that to happen.""

By James Shaw, BBC Scotland

It's after 10pm on a Thursday in the accident and emergency department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Tam Begbie is sitting on the hard vinyl floor talking to a young woman with peroxide blonde hair slumped in a chair in front of him.

In the hubbub of an A&E starting to get busier as the night goes on, no-one else can hear the substance of their conversation. But that is as it should be.

Tam is not talking to the woman to explain her treatment or to find out if she's committed a crime. He is simply trying to help. Because as a navigator, that is his job.

The agencies behind this scheme are Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit and the doctors' group, Medics Against Violence.

They decided on the job title, navigator, because it describes the aim of the role, which is to help people steer their way through the agencies that might be able to help them escape the lifestyles that are making them victims and possibly perpetrators of violence.

Tam discovers the young woman with the broken wrist got the injury in a fall. It might have happened during an argument with her boyfriend.

He is now in the reception area, wanting to see her. Tam might decide that it is not safe for them to get together at this point.

'Transformative effect'

But he will advise the young woman that he can meet her to talk about her situation tomorrow or the day after. Maybe in a cafe or fast food restaurant - wherever she feels comfortable.

He will suggest places where she might seek help. It might be relationship counselling or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Shelter if she needs to find somewhere new to live to escape an abusive relationship.

The genius of the navigator concept is that it offers help to people in the direst need at exactly the time when they might be most ready to make a change.

And it recognises that doctors and police officers cannot always offer permanent solutions to deep-rooted problems.

The value of the scheme is fully acknowledged by the head of A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Alastair Ireland. He allowed the navigators in last December and has seen the difference they can make.

At the moment, this is just a small pilot scheme, but doctors at the GRI agree that having navigators in every A&E in Scotland could have a transformative effect on the problems of violence they and the rest of society have to deal with.","['navigator', 'ae', 'navigators', 'glasgow', 'help', 'reduction', 'introduced', 'woman', 'young', 'unit', 'tackle', 'scheme', 'violence']","Image copyright Violence Reduction UnitA project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

A woman was strangled to death by her estranged husband minutes after telling her mother she felt ""wobbly"" about meeting him, a court has heard.

James McDonald, 37, wrapped Sophie McDonald's body in layers of plastic and hid it in a rubbish store, Exeter Crown Court heard.

He then lied to her family and police after she was reported missing.

Mr McDonald, of Iddesleigh Terrace, Dawlish, Devon, denies murdering her but has admitted killing her.

Mrs McDonald, 36, was attacked after going to his flat in January while the couple were negotiating an acrimonious break-up.

'Praying for her'

The court heard that when the marriage broke down Mr McDonald went to live in a flat they owned while Sophie and their three children stayed at the family home in Elm Grove Road.

Mrs McDonald's mother Elizabeth Brook was in contact with her on the day she was killed and told the court: ""I got a text at 14:35 saying she was going to see James at the flat.

""I texted back saying I was praying for her. She sent a message back a minute later saying she was feeling wobbly but was looking forward to seeing friends that night.

""I was going to text her back and ask her to take someone with her but I got distracted and never sent it. The next thing I knew was a call from her oldest daughter at about 16:15 asking if I knew where Sophie was.""

The jury have been shown an agreed timeline of events which included texts from Mr McDonald in which he alleged his wife was being unfaithful.

Statements from friends have revealed Sophie had joined the Dawlish Christian Fellowship and was going to Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to address drink and drug problems.

""This is absolutely fascinating, both culturally and technologically,"" tweeted Julie Fergusson. Zhang Yue built a 57-storey tower block in just 19 days. Now he wants to build the world's tallest skyscraper and says it will take just seven months. He explains how he plans to do it so quickly in the latest of our immersive long-form stories told using pictures, video and text.

""Great read written with a lot of affection and really places you in the mine,"" commented Barry Byrne. Who in their right mind would take a 10-year-old boy down a working coal mine? And yet that's exactly what happened to Bernard Hare, who has been recalling the experience of going down a pit in Methley, a village near Castleford. The value of that trip underground would only dawn on him years later.

""Fascinating article about the efficacy of 12-step programmes and the impact of the AA,"" tweeted Hack Circus. Eighty years ago Alcoholics Anonymous came into existence. Today, there are 115,326 AA groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. We look at the 12 steps to recovery and the other groups which have imitated their formula.

""This article is brilliant,"" posted Joseph Alexander. When the movie Jaws hit the big screen 40 years ago, it portrayed sharks as vengeful creatures. ""A collective testosterone rush certainly swept through the east coast of the US,"" says George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research in Gainesville. ""Thousands of fishers set out to catch trophy sharks after seeing Jaws."" But do the creatures really deserve their vicious reputation?

""What a heartbreaking story,"" posted Evgeny Tsiklauri. ""So sad, should never have happened,"" commented Stefanie. In 1951, Helene Thiesen and 21 other young Inuit children were taken away from their parents in Greenland as part of a social experiment. They were sent to Denmark to be re-educated as ""little Danes"". When they returned to Greenland the following year, they were not allowed to go back to their families but had to live in a children's home. Sixty-four years later, Thiesen has still not forgiven the Danish authorities.

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,"['News Elsewhere...', '...As Found Bbc Monitoring']",None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world

The Russian government is trying to tackle the country's notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app.

The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministry's leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russia's drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you can't change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24.

Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the city's health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russia's anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

I begged social services to take my children away,Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict before overcoming a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships.,[],None,"Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict, battling to get clean and sober. But she didn't want the methadone she was repeatedly prescribed by her local drugs service - she wanted to be abstinent. She tells Milly Chowles how she overcame a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships to beat her addictions by herself.

My husband didn't tell me it was heroin when he gave it to me to smoke. He told me it was cannabis resin. And then after about a week I really started to feel unwell.

There was a programme on the telly about a boy who had a habit and was withdrawing and I linked it to what I was experiencing. I woke my husband up in the middle of the night and absolutely went ballistic.

We had two children by then. I can remember saying: ""I don't want to do this no more, I don't want to go further,"" and begging him not to go and score. And he just didn't listen to me.

I remember just sitting in that front room watching him smoking, and feeling defeated.

The crack came in about a week later. I can remember watching him smoking it and he was going: ""Just try one, just try one,"" and I was like: ""No, no, I will never ever smoke that stuff,"" and I'd believe it when I was saying that.

But in the end I gave in, and I didn't stop for the best part of the next two decades.

It is a phenomenal force. It just takes over you.

I'd started shoplifting and offending, minor offences. I got arrested quite quickly and I went to prison.

My first sentence was only eight weeks, of which I served four. While I was there the children went into care for a little while. I managed to get them back when I came out, but two months later I'd been sectioned.

So I rang up social services from the psychiatric hospital and said: ""You need to go round to my house and take my children."" They'd been left with my husband who was using drugs - I knew they weren't safe. And they came, they took them, and they were adopted within a year. They never returned to my care again.

The adoption papers were signed while I was in prison. I'd gone from psychiatric hospital back on to the streets, back into prison. And that's how my life was for 15 years - in and out of psychiatric hospitals and in and out of prisons.

I can remember my last visit with my children and the obsession to use drugs was so strong that even as I took them down to the car, I was texting my dealer.

People say: ""Oh you'll find acceptance around it."" I accept that I was ill. And I can honestly say that would not have happened if I didn't have the substance in me. But it's something that I still haven't forgiven myself for. I don't know if I ever will.

I take full responsibility for my using and I don't blame my husband. I have an illness.

But addiction all comes down to relationships and being hurt again and again, and being left with no trust. I was always in a relationship and every relationship was dysfunctional. Every single one.

The really sad part of it is that I really thought these men loved me. When I began doing sex work they would sit and wait for me to get home and then they'd go to score with the money I'd just earned. Looking back now I really kick myself that I allowed that to happen - that I'd go out and let that stuff happen to me, and then give over my money and share what I'd just earned with somebody who didn't value me whatsoever.

How could they watch me go out there night after night, somebody who they're supposed to love and care about? I don't know how they could touch me after I'd gone and done that stuff.

One night I had a really bad experience. A punter raped me in his car. I just got out of that car. I didn't go home, I didn't tell my husband. I went back out and I found another punter. I don't remember much of the night but I remember those two punters.

I went straight back out again because of the obsession to use more drugs. I needed the money. It's that powerful. That's the control drugs had over me.

In the end I met somebody else while my husband was in prison, serving a long sentence. I went from this co-dependent using relationship to a very violent abusive relationship. The progression with each relationship, it just got worse. And again I stayed.

Once he headbutted me, to the point that I passed out. When I came round the first thing I said was, ""Oh, give me a cuddle please."" And I'm the one saying sorry for something I haven't done. Absolutely nuts.

I stayed in that relationship for about eight years.

It wasn't the heroin or crack that brought me to my knees in the end, it was the alcohol.

The two children from my second relationship had gone off to live with family. I was isolated in a flat on my own and my life for 18 months was waking up, and getting as much Tennent's Super in me as I could. Some days I was too frightened to go out the door and get my methadone script - I would rather sit there and withdraw as long as I had the Tennent's.

I couldn't even open the curtains in the end. Couldn't take sunlight on my face. I did not want to be in any type of reality at all.

I despised myself, absolutely despised myself.

My friend Pat died six days before I was due to go into rehab. I can remember just smashing my flat up. I must have been screaming so loudly that my neighbours rang the police and the police kicked my door in.

I was on my front-room floor, screaming that I didn't want to die. I'd never had a policeman hug me, but one of them hugged me. I must have looked such a mess.

I think it was in that moment I knew I'd had enough, I'd really had enough of it.

I'd been fighting to get into recovery for a long time. There were three different treatment centres and numerous detoxes along the way. But in May 2014 I went off to a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare. I was so angry when I got there that they put me on a behavioural contract almost immediately. They said if I didn't conform to it and stop arguing with everyone, that I would be discharged. I looked at this contract one night and thought: ""I'm not going to be able to do this."" And I knew if I got discharged I'd use. So I decided to take control and made a decision to leave of my own accord.

I was still heavily scripted on methadone and valium, I hadn't finished my alcohol detox. And I told them I was going. And they said: ""Where are you going?"" And I said I was going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London. And they looked at me like I was an absolute lunatic. And I probably was, a bit.

It was a big leap of faith. I was homeless because I couldn't go back to my flat because of bail conditions. I went to a meeting in Soho in London. And I sat in that meeting and I asked for help and that's what I got.

Three people in that meeting aren't with us any more, they're dead. I really do grasp how lucky I am.

After nearly 20 years of addiction and in drugs and alcohol services, the services didn't help me stop using. In fact, if anything I feel they kept me using longer with methadone prescriptions. They never once mentioned mutual aid groups. Their answer every time was more medication, never abstinence.

I stopped my script dead and I got clean in the meetings. And I am proud of that.

This month I will have been clean for three-and-a-half years.

Help with addiction

It's not been easy. I got made homeless six months ago which was really frightening, really scary. It was an on-the-spot eviction, I was asked to leave straight away. I didn't know where I was going. I didn't know what I was doing. But I got through it and I stayed clean.

I have complex PTSD, which I put down to to the sex working I did during my addiction. It affects every area of my life because I am so easily triggered. But I'm determined to recover from it. I didn't come into recovery to be like this. But it's manageable. I manage it, to get by.

I'm rebuilding a relationship with my oldest two children, and this Christmas was the first time I've had my daughter with me since 2012.

I now run women's recovery groups in a day centre and I'm doing well at college - I left school when I was 13.

No, I don't have a flat. No, I'm not in full-time employment. I'm living in a hostel, which is challenging at times, very challenging. But every time I look out my window and it's raining, gratitude just comes over me that I haven't got to go out in that rain and wait for a punter to come and pick me up.

It's not perfect at the minute, it's not great. But… it's all right. Life's all right.

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,"['Russell Hotten', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Levi Strauss

Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood.

The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"".

Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling.

Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons.

So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive.

But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky.

Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic.

There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights.""

One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh.

His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop.

""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life.""

Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast.

It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes.

""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18

So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get.""

He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time.""

Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal.

The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history.

Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades.

Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain.

If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product

But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"".

Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's.""

But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn.

Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership.

The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"".

Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted.

After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive.

""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim""

All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them.

""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated.""

More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:

Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India.

The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded.

Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less.

He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership.""

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The original US patent for riveted jeans, from 1873

Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong.""

Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership.

""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world.""

The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth.

Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levi's has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation.

However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. It's been harder and taken longer than I expected.

Sadie Frost says Mirror hacking caused 'living hell',"Actress Sadie Frost tells a hearing phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists made her life ""a living hell"" for many years.",[],None,"Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude Law

Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust.

In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers.

Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking.

She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature.

""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media.

""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person.

""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma.""

""I couldn't go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didn't trust my own mother.""

'Panic attacks'

Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult.

""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking.

""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse.""

She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her.

""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking.""

Image caption Sadie Frost said she was 'humiliated' when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting

Ms Frost said: ""I couldn't take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks.

""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"".

""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe.""

""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper.""

'Embarrassed and humiliated'

Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"".

""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court.

""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. That's not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

She added: ""I was portrayed for so long as a complete mess that I have had to overcome people's perception of me to rebuild my reputation as a successful businesswoman. I can only guess at the position I would be in if none of this had happened.""

She said that the apology she had received from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) was ""rather too little too late"".

The hearing at the High Court in London is considering what compensation should be paid by MGN to Ms Frost, alongside BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, former footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn.","['court', 'went', 'living', 'hacking', 'thought', 'jude', 'life', 'sadie', 'trust', 'safe', 'mirror', 'frost', 'caused', 'told', 'hell']","Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude LawActress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Former pop star Kerry Katona claimed politicians do not want to deal with people with problems as she discussed her cocaine addiction.

During a debate about what the government should do for addicts with Michael Portillo, Alan Johnson and Andrew Neil, she explained how she spent £100,000 on rehabilitation.

The discussion was prompted by Iain Duncan Smith's speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, where he said the state must 'go further' to help addicts.

"Ulster Bank: Man jailed for stealing £11,000 from faulty ATM","A recovering alcoholic is jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.",[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'

A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

A judge told Peter Anthony Young, 58, of Hunter's Way, Ardglass, that he had ""deliberately taken advantage'' of the major glitch in the bank's system almost four years ago.

It meant customers could withdraw funds from ATM machines without affecting their balance.

Following a check, the bank discovered the money had been withdrawn by Young.

A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on 22 June 2012, Ulster Bank had ""experienced a computer malfunction in its system''.

""Following a check, Ulster Bank discovered that Young, who was one of its customers, had £11,000 withdrawn from his account on that day,'' said Ms Ivers.

The judge was told there had been 22 separate withdrawals of £500 on the day in question.

The prosecution lawyer said the bank made repeated attempts to contact Young without success before eventually reporting the incident to police as ""fraudulent''.

The PSNI started an investigation and Young voluntarily attended a police station and admitted making the withdrawals, telling police he had ""spent the money on drink''.

The prosecution lawyer said the accused, who was a customer of the Ulster Bank, had ""made no effort to pay back the funds'' and the outstanding balance he owed now stood at £10,908.40.

A defence lawyer described it as an ""unusual case'' and said that when Young was interviewed by police in September 2014 he made ""frank admissions'' to his crimes.

""Reading between the lines from the court papers, it appears Mr Young was in the company of other people drinking with them that day and when he was taking money out it became apparent to him and the others that there was a fault with this machine,"" he told the court.

""This was always going to come home to him.

'Downward spiral'

""He is not in the least blaming others.''

The defence lawyer said that Young's life had ""taken a downward spiral'' following the death of his mother in 1991 and said that by the age of 34 he was an alcoholic, homeless and ""living on the streets of Belfast''.

The lawyer added that the father-of-five was now a recovering alcoholic, who was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, was part of a church group and was also attending a rehabilitation programme.

The defence lawyer said Young could be made the subject of a community order which ""would leave something hanging over his head that would remind him not to stray from the straight and narrow again''.

""I would urge the court to give him a chance to continue to improve himself,'' the lawyer added.

The judge said Young had gone to the machine on one occasion to withdraw £500 on the day in question.

""He chose to return to this machine a further 21 times to withdraw the money when he knew he did not have the funds in his account,"" he said.

""He knew full well what he was doing and he deliberately took advantage of the defective ATM.""

The judge said Young, who is living on social security benefits, had not repaid any money he had stolen from the Ulster Bank.

""I don't believe I could deal with this case by way of a suspended sentence. The least sentence I can impose is one of four months in custody.''","['bank', '11000', 'day', 'man', 'money', 'judge', 'lawyer', 'young', 'jailed', 'stealing', 'faulty', 'ulster', 'court', 'told', 'prosecution', 'atm']","Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

#BBCtrending: Bello! The UCL students spammed by their president,"An email simply reading 'bello' triggered 3,000 replies, and gave birth to a new meme.","['Bbc Trending', ""What'S Popular""]",None,"Image copyright @punderachiever

When students at a leading London university were sent a mysterious email from a senior official, the #Bellogate meme was born.

Students at University College London were sent an email last night, purportedly from the university president, Michael Arthur. It simply contained a one word greeting - ""bello"". By the morning, the message had generated a gigantic email thread, with some students waking up to almost 3,000 unread messages.

The hashtag was the top trend on Twitter overnight in the UK, with more than 5,000 tweets using the term since the ""Bello"" email appeared. Many shared emails generated in the thread - in which students continued spamming each other with jokes and puns. ""Bello? Is it me you're looking for"", read one - a play on a Lionel Ritchie song. Others sent invites to cyber security courses, and appealed for missing items of stationery. Some reported they had been signed up to porn sites, dating companies, Alcoholics Anonymous and Sarah Palin's website. A parody account soon emerged.

Most seemed to see the funny side. ""Ooo we all just got signed up to the Miley Cyrus mailing list. #Bellogate #BelloCameInLikeAWreckingBall"", the UCL Cheesegrater magazine tweeted. One PhD student wrote: ""The funniest thing happened to UCL in years, can't stop laughing."" While some have questioned UCL's security policies, and expressed frustration about having to delete hundreds of unwanted messages, the sharpest criticism was directed at students who kept posting to the thread, by hitting ""reply all"" to the original email.

UCL has apologised for ""multiple emails"" received by students, and shut down the mailing list concerned. It is not known yet who was responsible, although some have jokingly pointed the finger at UCL's rival, King's College. President Arthur has so far remained silent on the matter.

Election Lexicon: The lost significance behind this week’s buzzwords,A look behind some of the words that are making an impact in the general election campaign this week.,['Alan Connor'],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed)

Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign. So what words have caught the ear in week one of the 2017 contest?

Battle bus

Conservative candidates and officials learned this week that they would not face charges for breaches of expenses rules over use of a ""battle bus"".

But what precisely is a battle bus?

The exterior is grimly familiar: a shiny patina of party logos and rudimentary slogans.

But when the battle bus was first used in the UK, its insides were to change politics irrevocably.

Rather than have their spouses drive them to campaigning events, politicians of the late 1970s could travel in a six-wheeled office with state-of-the-art equipment - and not just the air conditioning.

Here's Margaret Thatcher with some unimaginably futuristic communications technology:

The perks were even greater for political journalists, who no longer had to drive in clumsy convoy with the party leaders or search for telephone booths to file their reports.

They too could stay connected - and as the kit advanced to the word processors and ""disc fax"" machines of the 1980s, speech-writing, campaigning and reporting all lived and breathed the same fervid, sometimes foetid, air.

Election live: Rolling updates

The words ""battle bus"", then, are not just a straightforward term for a mode of transport; they describe an accelerated kind of politics, where candidates are always on-grid and where the media are part of the machine. Everywhere is now a battle bus.

And the repercussions were keenly felt by the people most associated with the golden age of the battle bus - Davids Owen and Steel of the the Liberal/SDP Alliance - not least because each had his own bus, replete with period personalised windscreens.

Image copyright David Levenson Image caption David Owen and David Steel with their respective battle buses

Double the liberal fun - except that the onboard journalists rapidly realised that they could play the leaders off against each other in transit, getting a statement from one and getting the other to ridicule it before realising where it had come from.

Perhaps that's why today's Lib Dems have switched their affection to another futuristic conveyance...

Hovercraft

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron campaigned in a hovercraft this week in Burnham-on-Sea, apparently undaunted by the experiences of Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, who campaigned for the second of 1974's pair of elections using the same vehicle.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim Farron trying a different mode of transport on the campaign trail

Reasoning that voters could be found on beaches, Thorpe decided to surprise them by arriving from the sea in a campaign that ended only when colossal waves near Sidmouth nearly drowned the oilskinned candidate and left his hovercraft in pieces on the shingle.

At that time, there was one crucial difference about the word hovercraft. It tended to have a capital ""H"", as it was a proprietary term like Hoover or Portaloo.

The preferred generic phrase was ""air-cushion vehicle""; others used ""sea-saucer"" until the lower-case ""hovercraft"" took over.

Other terms you may not have realised are proprietary include Jacuzzi, Memory Stick, Quorn, Autocue and Rawlplug.

Draft manifesto

A draft simply means a drawing: a preliminary sketch, loose on the details, while manifesto is supposed to mean ""clear to the eye"" (as in, manifest). A draft manifesto in its very nature, then, is asking for trouble.

Labour's draft manifesto has been hastily converted to the real thing this week after a leak, which the Conservatives promptly described as ""a shambles"".

Shambles has never been a pleasant word: derived from a term for a bench, its original meaning is of that item of furniture as it is found at a butcher's: that is, a scene of quite literal carnage.

Image caption Malcolm Tucker: Originator of the term omnishambles

Worse still is an omnishambles, a term coined by writer Tony Roche for Malcolm Tucker to utter in The Thick of It which rapidly found itself being used by real-life politicians, an embrace which made the show's creator Armando Iannucci ""queasy and uneasy"".

Labour has tried to avoid being seen to play a subsequent blame game, a term popularised by Alcoholics Anonymous as a playing-out of recriminations that is best avoided.

In that spirit, Jeremy Corbyn has described himself as ""Monsieur Zen"".

Zen is the branch of Buddhism which holds that you should look not to scriptures (or perhaps to manifestos), but to a person's own heart.

There is no little irony here, given the charge that Labour's campaign is stressing the scripture over the man. Which brings us to...

Airbrushing

In a natty parallel, while Labour is accused of airbrushing Corbyn out of the party's campaign, the Conservatives have been described as airbrushing the word ""Conservatives"" in favour of images of their own leader.

Image copyright Getty Images

Airbrushing in politics used to be a much more literal business. For a despot to remove a rival from a photograph, all that was needed was a sharp scalpel.

But when it came to disguising your skulduggery, the airbrush was your friend, doing as its name suggests and spraying away to cover the evidence.

Nowadays, airbrush is used for metaphorical disappearance: if you've been removed from a picture, you're said to have been photoshopped (another proprietary term).

Digital tools for altering pictures are much more readily available than was the delicate airbrush, but that doesn't mean that anyone can use them - as Labour candidate Kate Hoey found this week when she tweeted a picture which was missing the head of rival candidate, Lib Dem George Turner - but not his legs.

Finally, for now...

The big six

In all the excitement over whether Theresa May's energy-cap proposal was a reheated version of an old Ed Miliband policy, word watchers were left wondering: why do we call those energy companies The Big Six?

The ""six"" part can be explained by counting them; allow Election Lexicon to explain the ""Big"".

The Big Six were originally the Big Four, and they weren't energy giants: they were the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St Louis Railway companies of the nineteenth-century US midwest.

It made for a snappier nickname than the merger's preferred CCC&StL anyway.","['used', 'hovercraft', 'word', 'battle', 'weeks', 'term', 'lost', 'election', 'caption', 'copyright', 'buzzwords', 'lexicon', 'image', 'campaign', 'significance', 'week']","Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed)Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign.

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,"['Bethan Bell', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England.

The barmaid who taunted a tiger

Image copyright Getty Images

In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britain's first recorded victim of a tiger.

She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pub's large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds.

Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death.

The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph:

In bloom of life

She's snatched from hence

She had not room to make defence;

For Tyger fierce

Took life away

And here she lies

In a bed of clay

Until the Resurrection Day.

The diver who saved a cathedral

Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images

William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral.

Large cracks had appeared in the cathedral's walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in.

Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done.

So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited.

A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement.

Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe.

As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday.

He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.""

The soldier whose beer was too weak

In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot.

Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens.

However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying.

Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read:

Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier,

Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer,

Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall

And when ye're hot drink strong or none at all.

In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit.

Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience.

In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book.

However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer.

On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetcher's death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier.

Peter the Wild Boy

Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces

Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk.

When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour.

The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave.

Peter's funeral was held at St Mary's Church, Northchurch, Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people.

At the time, courtiers assumed Peter's behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome.

The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith

St Mary's Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20.

Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention.

According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the King's shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard.

For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder.

However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block.

The Woodplumpton Witch

Nestled among the neat headstones at St Anne's churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton.

Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"".

She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage.

Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell.

The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave.

According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I don't believe in witches"", Meg's bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.","['unusual', 'gravestone', 'london', 'drink', 'headstone', 'death', 'winchester', 'way', 'grave', 'copyright', 'headstones', 'tell', 'water']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Peter Holder jailed for 1988 rape of woman,A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago is jailed.,[],None,"Image copyright Police Image caption Peter Holder admitted the charges at Reading Crown Court last month

A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago has been jailed for 11 and a half years after a review linked his DNA to the crime.

Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park. He drove her two miles before letting her go.

Holder, 48, from Tippett Rise, pleaded guilty in August to rape.

Reading Crown Court heard Holder was jailed for three years and four months in 2010 for another historical crime.

Holder pleaded guilty to an attempted rape he committed 1987 - five months before the Reading attack - following another cold case review.

'Frightened to go out'

Holder, who also admitted indecent assault and kidnap in relation to the 1988 attack, was only arrested in May this year when modern technology identified DNA found on the woman belonged to him.

Judge Joanna Cutts said the delay was caused either because of the technology at the time not identifying the DNA or because there had been no match found at the time.

On the night of the attack the woman had been drinking after leaving an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Alan Blake, prosecuting, said she realised that she was not safe to walk home so she went into a phone box in Watlington Street to call a taxi.

Lars von Trier unsure over film future,Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.,[],None,"Image copyright AP Image caption Born Lars Trier, he added the Von while at the National Film School of Denmark

Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.

The controversial film-maker, whose films include Nymphomaniac and Breaking the Waves, revealed his concerns in an interview with Danish paper Politiken.

He told the broadsheet he no longer drank a bottle of vodka a day or took ""narcotics"".

""I don't know whether I can make more films. And that haunts me,"" he said.

""No creative expression of artistic value has ever been carried out by former alcoholics and drug addicts,"" Von Trier told the newspaper.

It was his first interview since Cannes Film Festival organisers banned him from their event in 2011 after he joked he was a Nazi at a news conference to promote his science fiction film Melancholia.

Von Trier said he was 90 days sober on Sunday, adding he attended meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous every day.

Palme d'Or

He was quoted by the newspaper as saying he used to drink a bottle of vodka every day but to be creative he combined the alcohol with different kinds of drugs.

""I can't recommend anyone to do the same. It is very dangerous and stupid in every way,"" he said.

The director is perhaps best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers.

Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras.

In 2000 Von Trier won the Palme d'Or with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row.

His other films include Dogville, Manderlay and 2009's Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence.

Von Trier's most recent effort, the lengthy and sexually-explicit Nymphomaniac Director's Cut - Volume I and II, has been nominated for best film at the European Film Awards.

The awards will be handed out on 13 December in Riga, Latvia, this year's European Capital of Culture.

Being jailed for glassing woman helped Jan conquer her alcohol demons,'Being jailed for GBH helped me quit booze',"['Alice Gregr', 'Bbc Radio Manchester']",None,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption At the height of her addiction, Jan was consuming two bottles of wine each night

BBC Radio Manchester is taking a journey across Greater Manchester's 10 boroughs to meet some of the most inspiring people who live in the region. Here is the latest in the series:

Most recovering alcoholics talk about the moment they hit rock bottom.

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

For Jan, it was when she spent a year in prison for grievous bodily harm after being convicted of glassing a woman in an Alderley Edge bar.

The Stockport mother, who did not want to be identified in order to protect her daughter, says cannot remember anything of the 2008 incident.

At that time Jan was drinking about two bottles of wine a night.

Before then, she says she drank sensibly, in order to wind down from her job as a senior executive for a major oil company.

""I used alcohol as an emotional crutch,"" Jan explained. ""It started off as just a glass of wine after work and it turned into two bottles.

""I'd have cleaned a whole football stadium with a toothbrush if it would tell me why this was happening to me at the age of 40.""

Before being sent to prison she sought treatment for her alcoholism at a private clinic, and was sober when she was behind bars.

While serving her sentence at HMP Styal in Cheshire she helped others who were struggling to cope with life in prison and, as a result, gained a great deal of respect from other inmates.

And since her release she has been helping others battle addiction in Greater Manchester, saying she ""now has a better understanding of herself"".

""And I NEVER think of having a drink.""

Actress Lohan attends AA meetings,,[],2006-12-04 09:14:26,"Lohan is embarking on a number of more serious roles

Dina Lohan said it was a ""positive"" step for her daughter, who was scolded by a film studio boss earlier this year for ""unprofessional"" conduct.

""She's been attending some meetings and it's going to be a slow process,"" she told People magazine.

Lohan, 20, is best known for roles in children's movies such as Mean Girls, The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday.

The actress's party-girl image is frequently a focus for the tabloid press, and she is regularly photographed leaving nightclubs.

'Heavy partying'

""As a parent, you tell them what you can tell them, but she's 20 and I'm not going to say: 'Stay home and don't go out',"" her mother told a Los Angeles radio station.

""I'm there for support, and I'll obviously give her my opinion, but she's fine. She's very smart.""

In July, Morgan Creek Productions chief executive James G Robinson sent a letter to Lohan rebuking her for arriving late on set for the film Georgia Rule.

""You have acted like a spoiled child, alienated many of your co-workers and endangered the quality of this picture,"" he was quoted as saying in the letter.

He is also alleged to have accused the star of blaming her absence on heat exhaustion when he claims it was caused by ""all-night heavy partying"".

Lohan's mother said Mr Robinson was ""way out of line"" and insisted her daughter's claims were genuine.

India outrage over Goa minister's plan to 'cure' gays,"There is outrage in India after a minister in Goa says the state government is planning to set up centres to ""cure"" homosexuals and make them ""normal"".",[],None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people in India still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate

There has been outrage in India after a minister in Goa said the state government was planning to set up centres to ""cure"" homosexuals.

Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar said treatment would be offered to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders to make them ""normal"".

Many have taken to social networking sites to criticise Mr Tawadkar's ""shocking statement"".

India's treatment of homosexuals has been under the spotlight recently.

The Indian Supreme Court's 2013 decision to reverse a lower court order striking down a 153-year-old British colonial-era law criminalising homosexual acts caused global outrage with many describing it as ""disgraceful"".

According to Section 377 of the law, a same-sex relationship is an ""unnatural offence"" and punishable by a 10-year jail term.

A BBC correspondent in Delhi says although the law has rarely - if ever - been used to prosecute anyone for consensual sex, it has often been used by the police to harass homosexuals.

Also, in deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate and our correspondent says Mr Tawadkar's comment is an endorsement of that conservative thought.

""We will make LGBT [lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth normal. We will have a centre for them... like Alcoholics Anonymous centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" Mr Tawadkar said on Monday while discussing the Bharatiya Janata Party-run state government's policy report on youth.

""As in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out of the LGBT community so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" the minister added.

The minister's statement has led to outrage in India with many people condemning it on social media sites like Twitter.

Journalist Barkha Dutt said it was the ""insensitive"" minister who needed treatment:

Congress party spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi called it ""sick"":

Writer Aparna Jain wondered: ""Why are people we elect so stupid"":

Journalist Anahita Mukherji asked if there was any ""cure"" for Mr Tawadkar:

Activist Samar Anarya said the minister was ""homophobic"" and a ""fanatic"":

Meanwhile, the head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, who is visiting Delhi, said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" in India.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people - including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN chief said in a statement late on Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance,"" he added.","['samesex', 'law', 'goa', 'youth', 'cure', 'gays', 'used', 'outrage', 'mr', 'minister', 'relationships', 'copyright', 'india', 'ministers', 'plan']","Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people in India still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimateThere has been outrage in India after a minister in Goa said the state government was planning to set up centres to ""cure"" homosexuals.

Paul Gascoigne arrested after Leeming Bar takeaway row,,[],2010-02-08 16:14:51,"Gascoigne was arrested after an incident at a takeaway restaurant

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been quizzed by police after he was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in charge of a vehicle.

He was taken into custody on Sunday night after police were called to a disturbance at a takeaway in Leeming Bar, North Yorkshire.

The 42-year-old and another man were taken into custody for questioning.

Following a night in custody at Northallerton police station they were released on bail on Monday afternoon.

In December, Gascoigne was given a fixed penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly in Newcastle.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ""At 9.10pm on Sunday, officers from North Yorkshire Police were called to a disturbance at a takeaway at Leeming Bar.

""Following inquiries, two men, aged 42 and 40, from the Newcastle area, were arrested on suspicion of being drunk while in charge of a motor vehicle.

The former Newcastle and Tottenham midfielder has faced a long battle with alcohol and drugs, and was detained three times under the Mental Health Act in 2008.

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,[],None,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this year

Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism.

The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma.

His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out.""

Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January.

'Total wreck'

Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

""Three doctors didn't think I would make it,"" he said.

""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. I've come through that - death. I was dead.""

He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck.""

Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction.

He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said.

Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage.

On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoigne's management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals.

It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there.

'Another chance'

Gascoigne's drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl.

Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again.

""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them. I have to start going.

""I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I'm here, I have another chance - and I'm going to take it.""","['gazza', 'clinic', 'way', 'gascoigne', 'public', 'rehab', 'thought', 'going', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'paul', 'started', 'doctors', 'reveals', 'drama']","Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this yearFootball star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

Funeral of Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh,The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh.,[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption A red chilli and artichoke wreath reflected Dickson Wright's flamboyant nature

The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright has taken place in Edinburgh.

The 66-year-old, who found fame as one of the Two Fat Ladies, died in the city on 15 March.

Friends and relatives attended a service at the city's St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, followed by a private cremation.

As a food writer and broadcaster, Dickson Wright was known for her frank manner and strong opinions.

'Mass of contradictions'

Her love of food was highlighted at the funeral with an unusual wreath including red chillies and artichokes on top of her coffin.

Born in London, she trained as a barrister and was the youngest woman ever to be called to the Bar at the time.

Alcohol addiction put an end to her legal career but in the mid 1990s she was spotted by a TV producer while working in an Edinburgh cookery shop.

Image caption Clarissa Dickson Wright fronted Two Fat Ladies and several solo TV shows

Teamed with the late Jennifer Paterson, the duo travelled around in a motorbike and sidecar, creating feasts as well as a hit BBC 2 series.

Delivering a eulogy, the Very Rev Monsignor Michael Regan said: ""Through her education and upbringing she proved herself to be a brilliant woman and her career seemed destined for greatness but she had the self-destruct mechanism of so many gifted people and her downward spiral is well known.

""But from that downward spiral where she found herself homeless and penniless she learned a sympathy with others that stayed with her and through her association with Alcoholics Anonymous she found and gave strength to others.""

She was a ""mass of contradictions"", he added.

A piper played outside the city centre church as her coffin was carried at the front of grieving family and friends.

Dickson Wright also appeared in other shows, including Clarissa and the Countryman and Clarissa and the King's Cookbook, and served as rector of Aberdeen University.

Producer Patricia Llewellyn said following Dickson Wright's death: ""She was a force of nature and a true character, someone who knew how to tell a great story and had a fabulous sense of humour.""","['takes', 'tv', 'spiral', 'clarissa', 'woman', 'wright', 'wreath', 'ladies', 'dickson', 'place', 'wrights', 'funeral', 'red', 'edinburgh']","Image copyright PA Image caption A red chilli and artichoke wreath reflected Dickson Wright's flamboyant natureThe funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright has taken place in Edinburgh.

Asked why she had not talked about it before, she replied: ""It's no-one's business. That's why it's anonymous!""

""I don't drink when I go to clubs. I drink with my friends at home, but there's no need to.""

Tabloid fixture

Lohan's frequent partying and drunken exits from night clubs have been a fixture of tabloid newspapers in recent months.

In July, Morgan Creek Productions chief executive James G Robinson sent a letter to the actress rebuking her for arriving late on set for the film Georgia Rule, suggesting ""heavy partying"" was to blame.

""You have acted like a spoiled child, alienated many of your co-workers and endangered the quality of this picture,"" he was quoted as saying in the letter.

The actress now admits that she became worried by her portrayal in the press.

""I was like, 'I don't want to be written about at these clubs with these people',"" she told People.

""I work, I act, I have a living. That's what I do every day. I work every single day.""

Lohan has most recently been seen in Bobby, which centres on the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles in June 1968.

'Take my brain out': The artists awakened by brain injuries,"Thirty artists are exhibiting their work, many for the first time. The collective has only one thing in common - they all survived severe brain injuries.","['Beth Rose', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Phil

Thirty extraordinary artists who survived brain injuries, but found a new craft, are exhibiting their work in London this month, many for the first time.

For five days a week the art studio at Headway East London, set within a railway arch in Hackney, comes to life with people acquiring new skills and producing artwork.

Many had shown little or no interest in art until they were injured and invited into the studio.

Each member of Headway East London acquired their injuries as an adult. Some as a result of violent assaults, car crashes or meningitis, while others are from less common causes including hypoxia - a suffocation injury.

Ben Graham from the Headway charity says: ""Quite a few of the people we're tending to see can't do their former jobs, or their relationships have broken down or maybe they're the parent but need caring for themselves.

Sandra Lott worked in banking in the City of London and would often travel to Europe and America on business. She suffered head trauma in 2013. The resulting injury means she walks with a stick, has cognitive fatigue and aphasia - a communication disorder.

""When I was at work, I fell over and security got me to the hospital. I was there for three days and then I was okay, but then I fell over on the stairs. Me and my friend we just had a coffee. I was walking around Liverpool Street and there were loads of steps, and that's when I fell on them.

""I was sick for a year. But then, when I came to Headway I just loved it.""

Sandra enjoyed art as a child, but gave up as a teenager. One of the pieces she is exhibiting, Witches and Buildings, was inspired by 9/11. She had been working in New York shortly before.

""I had crabs and lizards and there was a man who was going into a helicopter - they were helping them after the World Trade Centre. That was because three weeks before, I went to the city. All the people who died, it was awful.""

Sandra says her family has been very supportive of her art.

""My husband's going to come to the exhibition. He loves it. My husband is a photographer. I used to help him. I think in 2017 I would like to help his photography - I really want to do it.""

Headway East London started in 1997 with one therapist and a single client. It's since grown and offers a variety of services. Rather than short-term rehabilitation with a discharge date it hopes to offer support as long as is needed; helping to redefine the person and giving them a positive outlook and productive use of their time.

Many of the 40 members who use the studio now consider art their job.

Graham says ""Therapy is about making yourself better, but what they're doing is about making something, selling it to people, engaging with the public and forming an identity they feel comfortable and happy with.

Image copyright Headway East London

""Essentially they're no longer unemployed, which affects their self-worth, and gives people that root to self-expression.""

Headway is based in a unit complete with a kitchen, gym and therapy rooms with the Submit To Love Studio next door providing a bespoke space for painting, sculpting and ceramics.

When it first opened Graham says it led to an ""explosion"" of artwork and an ""astonishing uptake"" which they hope to continue nurturing.

Nick Mayers, 56, had spent 16 years in the Parachute Regiment before he had two strokes in one year. The second resulted in a haemorrhage which has affected his speech, memory and mobility. Nick will often paint images he sees in books.

Image copyright Nick Mayers

""I was born, Nicholas Mayers. I was born 4th January, Battersea Park. When I was four-years-old I first started to paint.""

Nick's strokes meant he has had to teach himself how to draw using his left hand, despite having grown up right-handed.""

For anyone thinking of taking up art Nick has some advice: ""Make it up as you go along. When I finish painting I never look back. Don't get attached.""

Some of the artists have exhibited before but for many it will be the first time the public has a chance to see and buy the pieces with any profits split 50/50 between the artist and charity.

Graham says Headway East London is ""not in a hurry to make it a commercial enterprise"" but already prices have increased. Drawings used to go for about £20, but one artist has sold a piece for £1,600 and has a further eight chosen for £2,400.

""I don't think financial gain is the priority. Feeling valuable and engaged and pursuing something meaningful to them is the most important thing, and in a setting where they're connecting with others,"" Graham says.

""They're doing art for its own sake. It's a really exciting time for us and we all share that sense of pride together as a community.""

Phil, a 44 year old father-of-two, was a pedestrian in a road traffic accident in 2015. He has problems with physical and cognitive fatigue, memory and concentration.

Image copyright Phil

""I used to draw for my kids. I suppose I did have an eye but it didn't connect to how I would normally do things.

""I was really confused that I couldn't draw a line. Before the accident I would have been fine.""

He said he struggled at first spending whole days working on it before declaring ""I've failed"" but after taking a more relaxed approach art has become his release.

""The piece I'm doing now - it's massive. It's a painting collage. It's a bit to do with me - the dark to the light. I think it's like my journey of this accident.""

Image copyright Brian Searle

He says before he started at Headway he wasn't sure what to expect.

""People think it's like AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] - where you sit around in a circle and give out your feelings. This is totally different. This is my space from 10 'til 3, I take my brain out and recharge it.

""It's a wonderful place to recharge my brain and I'm allowed to be myself.""

The 39-year-old, who was not injured, said he was being followed by a photographer when the accident happened near his home in Sydney, Australia.

""I sped up, and in an effort to elude an oncoming car, which was making an illegal U-turn, saw no choice but to drop my bike,"" he said in a statement.

Urban added that his pursuer came to his assistance ""without taking photos"".

The New Zealand-born singer, who grew up in Australia, completed a three-month stint in rehabilitation for alcohol abuse earlier this year.

He checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, last October, less than four months after his wedding to actress Nicole Kidman.

While in the clinic he missed the release of his latest album, Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Thing, and was not present to accept his second male vocalist of the year honour at the Country Music Association Awards.

Devon SMART Recovery groups for addicts to expand,A group which offers science-based support for addicts plans to expand its service in Devon.,[],None,"Image caption There are 80 SMART recovery groups in the UK and about 650 worldwide

A group which offers science-based support for people with alcohol, drug and gambling addictions plans to expand its service in Devon.

Self Management and Recovery Training (SMART) uses motivational, behavioural and cognitive methods.

The NHS Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team is spending £4,000 to help it form more groups in the county.

SMART Recovery currently has seven groups and hopes to open a further 10 in the next two years.

The organisation said it gives people alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

'Addictive behaviour'

SMART Recovery uses a four-step plan which helps participants decide whether they have a problem, builds up their motivation to change and offers a set of techniques to support recovery, a spokesperson said.

Richard Phillips, director of SMART Recovery, said: ""We have evidence that all the individual techniques work.

""Clearly AA and NA work very well for some people, for other people SMART Recovery might work better.

""Our approach is very much to place the responsibility of change within the individual, they've got the ability to choose to change their addictive behaviour.""

Kristian Tomblin, from the Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said it was important to have a range of services in place to accommodate different needs.

Mr Phillips said there was 650 groups worldwide with 80 in the UK.

Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate teenagers about the dangers of alcohol.

Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

The play, by Bryan Bounds, is about the life of Bill Wilson the found of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Bounds said the drama allowed students to learn about alcoholism and its destructive effects.

'Growing concern'

My Name is Bill, which is performed by Mr Bounds, the founder of the Leeds-based Amerrycan Theatre, was shown to critical praise at the Edinburgh Fringe and has been adapted for use in education.

Mr Bounds, himself a recovering alcoholic, said: ""I've watched with growing concern about how alcohol has become such a big issue for young people.

""A lot of alcohol education is quite patronising and condescending but students are very switched on, very sophisticated.""

The Centre for Public Health said Harrogate was second only to Wakefield in Yorkshire for alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s.

The drama is being shown to Year 12 students at Ashville College and St Aiden's School.

Marion Farrar, business liaison officer at St Aiden's School, said: ""I think young people see alcohol as a norm these days which is a worrying trend.

""It is becoming more and more what you do on a night out as a matter of rite.""","['shown', 'schools', 'students', 'play', 'st', 'public', 'harrogate', 'alcohol', 'bounds', 'yorkshire', 'teenage', 'young', 'tackle', 'drinking', 'theatre', 'drama']","Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

Teacher Steven Watt struck off for drunken behaviour at music camp,A primary teacher is struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.,[],None,"A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Steven Watt, 41, was employed by Angus Council at the time of the incident in October 2011.

At a General Teaching Council hearing, he admitted charges including being intoxicated while caring for children.

A panel determined Watt's behaviour fell ""significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher"" and deemed him unfit to teach.

The complaint to the General Teaching Council for Scotland related to incidents during a music band camp on the evening of 28 October and the next morning.

Alcohol problem

The panel heard Watt engaged in conversation and made remarks to a number of children in his care which were ""inappropriate and offensive"".

He suggested to a number of male pupils in a dormitory that he was conducting a survey. He then asked one pupil if he was ""camp"" and told him ""it was okay to be gay these days"".

The teacher then stroked the same pupil's arm and got into his bed.

A further charge said he later drove a vehicle while ""intoxicated by alcohol or some other substance"".

Parts of the hearing were held in private in order to protect the identity of the children involved.

Watt told the panel he had suffered from an alcohol problem for much of his life but following the incident at the music camp he was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He said he not had an alcoholic drink for more than a year.

Watt said he missed teaching and that he would like to return to the profession.

The teaching council told Watt a period of two years would have to pass before he could apply to re-register with the council.

The panel also suggested his name be referred to Scottish ministers under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.","['camp', 'behaviour', 'teacher', 'watt', 'steven', 'panel', 'struck', 'scotland', 'told', 'suggested', 'council', 'teaching', 'music', 'drunken']","A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Denise Gough's role as a recovering addict in the National Theatre's People, Places and Things was one of the theatrical highlights of 2015. As the play transfers to the West End, audiences have another chance to see the performance that could win her an Olivier award next month.

What a difference a year makes.

At the beginning of 2015, Denise Gough almost quit acting. She couldn't make ends meet.

""I had a year out of work before this job,"" explains the Irish actress. ""I applied to be a cleaner this time last year. That's not joking. That's the truth for many jobbing actors and actresses.

""It would be lovely if we were all in a position to say it's vulgar to talk about money, but most of us have to talk about it because we can't pay our rent when we are out of work.""

As things turned out, Gough didn't get the cleaning job. But she did land the lead role in Duncan Macmillan's new play, People, Places and Things. Her performance was described as ""career-changing"", ""Class-A"" and ""emotionally shattering"".

Directed by Jeremy Herrin, the play was a sellout at the National's Dorfman Theatre last year. It begins with Gough's character Emma having a meltdown during a production of Chekhov's The Seagull. Soon she's in rehab and on a 12-step programme to tackle her addiction to drink and drugs.

Gough won the Critics' Circle best actress award for the role in January and was nominated in the same category at last year's Evening Standard theatre awards, where she was beaten by Nicole Kidman for her role in Photograph 51.

Gough and Kidman go head to head again at the Olivier awards on 3 April in a best actress field that also includes Gemma Arterton (Nell Gwynn), Janet McTeer (Les Liaisons Dangereuses) and Lia Williams (Oresteia).

People, Places and Things has four Olivier nominations in total - including best new play.

Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption People, Places and Things has four nominations at this year's Olivier Awards

So how ""career-changing"" has it been for Gough?

""What this has done has changed the level that I'm at,"" she says. ""I had never worked at the National before and now I can talk about projects that I want to do.""

Also important to her is the type of role it is. ""This character is indicative of the kind of parts we need for women on stage - and on film and TV. A woman that is not an appendage to a man.

""After a while it gets tiresome falling in love over and over on stage. This part for me is such a fantastic addition to the canon of parts that will now be available for young women to play.""

Gough leans in, speaking quickly as she warms to her theme. ""A young guy came up to me about a month after our play finished [at the National]. He said he went to see our play and the day after he went to his first AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting and he's been clean and sober since.

""I know that we're always talking about theatre having the power to change lives, but it really does. I'm proud to be part of something where I'm saying something more than, 'Aren't I pretty in a dress?' I'm not just wafting around the stage.""

She pauses, and then adds with a smile: ""Although I will be wafting around the stage in other productions - just not this one.""

Gough is a supporter of the 50/50 by 2018 campaign which wants to see women represented on screen, in television and theatre in equal numbers to men.

""We are 50% of the population and yet in film less than a third of the speaking characters are female. That has to change. I think of my niece. I want her to watch things and be able to go to the theatre and see herself on stage.

""The conversation is starting and it needs to keep going. The more represented we are the more we can address the gender pay gap.""

Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption The play begins with Gough's character Emma having a stage meltdown during a production of Chekhov's The Seagull

In 2014, Gough played Julia alongside Gemma Arterton in The Duchess of Malfi at the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare's Globe. Her previous London theatre credits include Jesus Hopped the A Train, Six Characters in Search of an Author and As You Like It.

She won the Critics' Circle Award in 2012 for most promising newcomer for Desire Under the Elms at the Lyric Hammersmith.

""I said in my speech at the time I'd been around for about 12 years!"" recalls Gough.

""I have been thinking about that a lot. If that award had happened when I was a newcomer at 23 I don't think I'd have been ready for any of that. I'm having a tiny taste of attention around my work since last year. I don't know how really young people deal with that.

""I'm very glad to be mid-30s and a bit more grounded. It's very seductive and you can become a bit of an arse if you're not careful.""

She offers an anecdote about why she'll resist the trappings of fame. ""I went home recently and a magazine on which I'm the front cover was in the bidet in my parents' bathroom.

""Not on it - in it! That is why I will never forget where I've come from.""

Boy George has become a patron of Focus 12, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity based in Suffolk.

The singer and DJ said he wanted to spread the word that help is available for people who are struggling with addiction, and to their families.

""The important thing is for people to know there is a way out of it - there's Focus 12, NA (Narcotics Anonymous) and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous),"" he said.

He said the support and publicity provided by the patrons had kept Focus 12 running.

Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, made his name with Culture Club and has himself battled with drug addiction.

""It did used to be something that was associated with music and celebrities, but nowadays it's so widespread,"" he said.

A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction.

Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses.

Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said.

""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations.

""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what I've been through.""

'Wallowed in sadness'

Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group.

I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years.

In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women.

By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women.

""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said.

""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them.""

Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer.

At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge.

""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said.

""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters.""

'Rock bottom'

Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son.

Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago.

""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people don't.""

Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers.

""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said.

""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it.

""I don't think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years.

""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""","['drink', 'alcoholic', 'problem', 'number', 'drinking', 'mr', 'young', 'martin', 'alcohol', 'scared', 'drinkers', 'alcoholrelated', 'rise']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Trending: Why Jim Wolf's makeover video went viral,A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has garnered more than 13 million YouTube hits in a week - but why do stories about the homeless gain such traction on social media? BBC Trending investigates.,"['Bbc Trending', ""What'S Popular""]",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The two-hour make-over of a US Army veteran is shown in two minutes

A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has been watched more than 13 million times on YouTube in the past week.

In two minutes, former soldier Jim Wolf is shown making the transition from bearded and bedraggled to well-groomed and sharply-suited. Since then, the 54-year-old - who has long struggled against poverty, homelessness and alcoholism - has reportedly started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is now staying with his sister.

Producer Rob Bliss made the video to raise awareness and funds for a Grand Rapids homeless charity, Degage Ministries - which has received $50,000 (£30,000) in donations as a result.

Mr Wolf's is not the first story of this kind to gain such traction in social media networks. In September, donations of more than $110,000 (£70,000) poured in for Glen James, a homeless man in Boston who returned a lost bag containing £26,000 in cash and travellers cheques. Billy Ray Harris was able to buy himself a house in Kansas with £110,000 given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a £2,500 diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year.

And in 2011, offers of radio work flooded in for Ted Williams after his smooth baritone was recorded by a local newspaper reporter who saw him asking for money by an Ohio roadside.

The release of the Jim Wolf video - timed to coincide with Veterans Day - has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as ""pretty incredible"" - far outperforming any other content he has produced.

""The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,"" he told the BBC. ""The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be.""

Alastair Murray, Project Director at Housing Justice, a UK-based Christian campaigning charity says the video reminds the audience of the possibility of losing a job, a home, and a stable life. ""This video helps people see the real person behind that bearded needy person about whom they feel awkwardness - there's a transformation into a person with whom you'd be happy to have a chat,"" he says.

Larne man avoids prison for attack on Alliance Party office,A County Antrim man who broke into an Alliance Party constituency office with an axe and crowbar is given a suspended sentence.,[],None,"A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar.

Charles Mervyn Jamison, 39, from Old Glenarm Road, Larne, pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to cause unlawful damage.

He was given a 12 month sentence, suspended for three years.

The judge at Antrim Crown Court said the act of ""wanton vandalism"" was an ""attack on the right of people to freely hold their political views"".

The court heard that Jamison was arrested on 19 July 2013, after police received a report of a ""smashing sound"" coming from the rear of a property on Larne's Main Street.

Dislike

They entered the property through a broken window and found Jamison inside the main hall of the premises, where an Alliance Party office is also located.

A prosecuting lawyer said: ""The defendant was holding an axe and crowbar and was smashing the door and lock of the door to the Alliance Party office.

""He gave the impression of being very intoxicated and was arrested. Asked why he was attacking the office, he said, 'I just don't like the Alliance Party'.

""He admitted during interview that the axe and crowbar were his and he intended to enter the office and trash it.

""He apologised for his actions. He was literally caught red-handed.""

The prosecutor added that the incident was not part of a ""planned or orchestrated campaign"".

A defence barrister said the incident was ""utterly and completely disgraceful"".

""Mr Jamison works in a fishing tackle shop in the same building and, for whatever reason, which was associated with the consumption of alcohol, committed this offence.""

The defence lawyer confirmed to the court that Jamison had worked as a coach builder for ten years but had to give it up after he fell ill with epilepsy.

'Distress'

He said he was working part-time and had saved up the money to repay what is owed for the office repairs.

""To show how he has progressed, he has not consumed alcohol since this incident, he is voluntarily attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and he has not come to the attention of the police since.""

The judge told Jamison: ""It has been made very clear that you were not part of any orchestrated campaign against the Alliance Party office or the Alliance Party in general.

""That is not to lessen the distress that would have been caused to persons who worked in that office, while you worked part-time in a fishing tackle shop in the same premises.

""There is no doubt these persons and anyone attending the office in which they are entitled to do would have been quite rightly distressed by this wanton vandalism by this defendant.""

He added that Jamison had shown an ""element of remorse"" through his early guilty plea and that had he contested the case, the defendant would have been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

On top of the 12 month sentence, suspended for three years, the judge ordered the destruction of the axe and crowbar and also granted a compensation order of £1,390 to the landlord of the property.","['incident', 'larne', 'attack', 'man', 'worked', 'judge', 'jamison', 'alliance', 'property', 'crowbar', 'party', 'prison', 'office', 'axe', 'avoids']","A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar.

Production halted on Charlie Sheen sitcom after remarks,"Production of Two and A Half Men is halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.",[],None,"Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon

Production of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Sheen slammed the programme's producer in a radio interview on Thursday.

The decision was based on the ""totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition"", Warner Bros Television studio and the CBS network said in a joint statement.

The 45-year-old actor has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon.

Production of the show had been postponed since late January after Charlie Sheen, the son of Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, entered rehabilitation for reported drug and alcohol abuse.

The actor's publicist had said earlier on Thursday that Two and a Half Men would resume production next week when Sheen had finished his rehabilitation.

But the statement by CBS and Warner Bros Television was issued after Sheen phoned into a US radio programme to criticise the programme's co-creator Chuck Lorre, as well as Alcoholics Anonymous.

The actor - one of America's highest-paid stars - was taken to hospital in Los Angeles with severe abdominal pains late last month before entering rehab.

He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences.

In late October 2009, Sheen was accused of causing damage to a hotel room in New York. After hotel security reported he was disorderly, the actor voluntarily went with authorities for a psychiatric evaluation.","['remarks', 'late', 'production', 'warner', 'actor', 'sheen', 'halted', 'television', 'street', 'wall', 'sitcom', 'charlie', 'reported', 'radio']","Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and PlatoonProduction of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Former England star Paul Gascoigne was arrested for the second time in two days after a disturbance at a hotel.

The ex-footballer, 42, was taken into custody along with another man by police called to the Blackwell Grange Hotel in Darlington on Monday night.

He was later released without charge after being questioned on suspicion of a public order offence.

The men had been arrested the previous night on suspicion of being drunk in charge of a vehicle in North Yorkshire.

They were released on bail on Monday evening over the incident at a takeaway in Leeming Bar.

But they were soon back in custody after staff at the Darlington hotel called police.

Gascoigne was freed without further action, but the second man, aged 40, was given a fixed penalty notice.

The former Newcastle and Tottenham midfielder has faced a long battle with alcohol and drugs, and was detained three times under the Mental Health Act in 2008.

He told BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire last year he had been clean of drink and drugs for four months, and had attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.","['drugs', 'gascoigne', 'darlington', 'man', 'suspicion', 'released', 'second', 'paul', 'arrested', 'previous', 'hotel']","Gascoigne and the second man had been arrested the previous nightFormer England star Paul Gascoigne was arrested for the second time in two days after a disturbance at a hotel.

Lots of readers have been commenting on the short clip of Sirga the lioness rushing to hug the man who rescued her when she was a cub. When Valentin Gruener opens her cage, Sirga ecstatically throws her paws around his neck. Allan Ainsworth says on Facebook that it shows ""animals know - and recognise - kindness"". It reminds him of a story ""where two fellas had a lion cub from Harrods"". Allan recalls that the lion was rehoused in Africa. ""The two guys went out some time later… It threw itself at them both in an embrace of love and fondness."" Allan has remembered correctly, and in that reunion in 1972, Christian the lion reacts in a very similar way to Sirga.

Scoop of the 60s

Here's an unusual way to get a scoop: hide your camera in a bouzouki guitar. One tip though, this may only work if you're trying to get a story in the kind of place where there are actually bouzouki players. Stumped for the kind of place where there are bouzouki guitars? Try a Greek shipping magnate's yacht. That's where young Greek journalist Nico Mastorakis sneaked on to get the scoop that Jackie Kennedy was going to marry Aristotle Onassis. For Christiane Vejlo this was an insight into the early days of paparazzi work, while Joanna Williams thinks it tells us something about press freedom 40 years ago.

How's this for deciding what tax rate to pay. Alex Duval Smith walked into the tax office and was told, ''You have the choice between two income tax regimens, 30% or 3%, which shall it be?'' She went for 3%. And that's how they do tax in Mali. There's a logic to this. The government believes the 3% rate will attract more tax payers. At the moment they struggle to raise 1% or 2%. So this new rate represents something of an increase, she's told.

Just prior to the introduction of the 30mph speed limit in the UK, there were only around one-tenth of the cars on the road today, but four times as many associated deaths. There had been a 20mph speed limit set in 1903 but it was repealed in 1930. The spate of deaths caused a change of heart in government in 1934 and the 30mph limit was brought in. But it still has its opponents. They argue speed limits don't improve safety because drivers just focus on speedometers. Transport researcher Anna Plyushteva responds to that argument on Twitter with one word: hilarity.

How did the UK get the 30mph limit?

Fidelity in marriage is written into French civil law. So given this, is it illegal for a dating website to promote adultery? That is the question underlying a lawsuit targeting the French company Gleeden. In Article 212 of the Civil Code, it states: ""Married partners owe each other the duty of respect, fidelity, help and assistance."" Meanwhile, Gleeden's advertising campaign is a woman in a wedding dress with her fingers crossed behind her back. Indeed, Gleeden says 80% of the people who use it are indeed married. On Facebook, Hilary Banks points out that this isn't a solely French phenomenon - English dating sites have an option in their ""what are you looking for"" section which is ""married, looking for sex"".

It was an eight-second clip and had been watched over four million times. But her reaction is surprising. She started her own YouTube channel to let people know who the person behind the ""World's Ugliest Woman"" video really was. Tweeters were inspired by her story of triumphing over adversity.

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been fined over a drunken disturbance in Newcastle.

The 42-year-old was arrested for being drunk and disorderly in the Jesmond area of the city in the early hours.

He was taken into custody and later received a fixed-penalty notice, said Northumbria Police.

The ex-Newcastle and Tottenham player has faced a long battle with alcohol, and last year was detained twice under the Mental Health Act.

In a BBC interview earlier this year, he said he had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and claimed to have been clean of drink or drugs for four months.

He said: ""In the past every time I left rehab I thought I'm going to have a drink and I had no thought of that this time.

""I am a different Paul now.""

Gascoigne began his career at Newcastle in 1985, and in 1988 transferred to Tottenham for £2.3m, having played 99 games and scored 25 goals.

He shot to fame during the 1990 World Cup in Italy, when he helped England to the World Cup semi-finals.

A north London church has raised £50,000 for community projects by renting spaces in its car park.

All Saints Church near Kings Cross and St Pancras stations, raised the amount after it advertised the parking spaces online through Parkatmyhouse website.

The money allows the church to provide space for a care group for toddlers, and to provide free breakfasts for up to 70 homeless people.

More than 1,000 drivers, mostly train passengers, used the facility in 2009.

The church, which first advertised the spaces in 2007, said that two-thirds of its customers were railway passengers.

The head of a Cornish drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit says he fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.

Bosence Farm near Hayle, treats patients on programmes lasting from nine to 12 months.

Derek Mace says he fears these may now be cut back because of the uncertain economic climate.

The Department of Health says a final decision will not be made until later this year.

Bosence Farm has been providing residential help for people with drug and alcohol dependence since 1995.

Mr Mace said: ""Those people who stay around for nine or 10 months are the ones who are best equipped to engage properly with the wider society and stay off drink and drugs on a permanent basis.""

The addiction recovery programme includes psychotherapy, yoga, meditation and relaxation.

Staff use a 12-step programme recommended by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

'Amazing benefits'

Jack, who has been a patient at the farm for nine months, said: ""I came to save my life really. I would be dead otherwise, I took heroin, alcohol, pills, anything really.

""This is the first 12-step programme I have ever tried. The benefits I am getting from it now are amazing. If I left after six months it would have been a complete waste of time. You're going straight back into the lion's den.""

Bob Crossland, of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Drug and Alcohol Action Team said, he was more optimistic about funding.

""Payment by results is a worry for a lot of people for lots of reasons, but it's also a potential opportunity to get more money in the future.""

Gibson drink-drive charges erased,,[],2009-10-07 08:59:27,"Mel Gibson pleaded no contest to the drink-driving charges in 2006

Mel Gibson's conviction in 2006 for drink-driving has been expunged from his record, it has been confirmed.

The Oscar winner's lawyer requested the dismissal after the star successfully completed the terms of his probation.

The star had been ordered to perform public service work and attend Alcoholics Anonymous for three years.

Gibson's arrest sparked outrage after a leaked police report quoted him making anti-Semitic comments to the arresting officer in California, who was Jewish.

He has since repeatedly apologised for the remarks, saying his outburst did not reflect his true views.

Gibson had pleaded no contest to driving 87mph (140km/h) with an open bottle of tequila in his hand. He also had a 0.12 percent blood alcohol content, where the legal limit in California is 0.08.

As a first-time drink-driving offender, Gibson was eligible to have his conviction expunged after fulfilling his probation and maintaining a clean driving licence.

Although it has been removed, the conviction could still expose the actor to more serious charges if he is ever arrested again for driving under the influence.

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?","['Olivia Sorrel-Dejerine', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Image copyright Thinkstock

Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic?

The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review.

Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?""

And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word.

Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics can't hold down jobs.

None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative.

""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who don't fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isn't quite normal.""

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasn't alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says.

There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"".

But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect.

Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk.

People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help.

""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says.

Not all experts share this view, however.

There's a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isn't"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century

She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial.

""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, 'I don't drink as much as my friends so it's OK.'""

There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century.

England's Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage.

""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says.

The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction.

""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about 'alcohol dependence', but you don't hear people in the street saying he is an 'alcohol dependent,' they say he is an 'alcoholic,'"" he says.

Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker aren't used more widely.

The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term 'alcohol dependence'. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control.""

For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic.

This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didn't meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I don't have a drinking problem"", he says.

""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, 'Do I have a problem or not?'""

Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"".

""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic.

""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics.""

""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics.""

Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says.

But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed.

""I feel that eight months ago I wouldn't have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

Quaker faith helps alcoholic to quit drinking,,['Shani Ryan'],2010-01-28 09:24:32,"Shani Ryan

BBC Essex

Anthony has not had a drink since August 1984 A recovered alcoholic from Maldon said he has his Quaker faith to thank for helping him stay alive. Anthony told BBC Essex's Ian Wyatt he started to drink when he was 20, shortly after joining the Air Force. Having had a religious upbringing as a Pentecostalist, he had never previously drank or smoked. After 25 years of addiction Anthony attempted to take his own life at which time he sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous and the Quaker church. Drink, claimed Anthony - not his real name - had an awful impact on most aspects of his life, including his work. ""I drank uncontrollably from the start, and it got out of control very early on. I used to lose count, after about the first four or five,"" he said. ""I was a passenger at work... for a long time,"" he added. He worked as a journalist in Fleet Street, where there was a very heavy drinking culture at the time. But after a terrible binge, when he ""disgraced' himself"" after going ""completely haywire,"" his editor told him it ""couldn't go on, it was an embarrassment,"" and asked what he should tell his work colleagues. Anthony replied: ""Tell them I'm an alcoholic."" I still have to do things today to maintain the sobriety - and part of that is leading a spiritual way of life. Prayer and meditation, and attending Quaker meetings

Recovering alcoholic Anthony Despair Drink also caused absolute devastation to his family. Anthony described how he was so wrapped up in himself he did not realise the damage it was doing to his wife and children. He said: ""People call us selfish, but the compulsion is so powerful I felt I had no choice over it and couldn't stop."" Anthony explained that, towards the end, alcohol was a ""dreadful, dreadful curse"" and tried all he knew not to be a drunk, but could not manage it. In the end Anthony reached a state of absolute despair and tried to kill himself with a massive overdose. He was taken to hospital and it was whilst he was there a psychiatrist suggested he join AA. Anthony said: ""I knew that if I drank again I would most certainly die and I was frightened of dying."" When he was at rock bottom Anthony had given up on religion and by the time he joined Alcoholics Anonymous he was a ""very surly, suspicious agnostic - whether there was a God seemed completely irrelevant to me."" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Through AA however he found another path. ""AA meetings are held in all sorts of places,"" he said. ""Clinics, prisons, and lots of churches. The particular group that I joined in 1984 in Hertfordshire was in a Quaker Meeting House. ""In there was a poster on the notice board which said 'a silent meeting for worship can be a quiet process of healing and a journey of discovery.' ""It intrigued me and so I began attending. I liked the fact I was accepted for who I was."" Anthony has not touched alcohol since August 1984. ""I still have to do things today to maintain the sobriety - and part of that is leading a spiritual way of life. Prayer and meditation, and attending Quaker meetings.""

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,"['Sally Marlow', 'Addiction Researcher', 'Institute Of Psychiatry']",None,"Image copyright Science Photo Library

Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated?

Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify.

A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing you're addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house.

Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly.

But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day?

As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction.

The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together.

About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4's Today programme and for Inside Health

Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity.

Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip.

It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction.

One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater.

He said: ""It's difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think it's just a bigger version of that.

""It's a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food.

""It is hell being there in that place.""

Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating.

She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most.

""I think what's most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says.

What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges

Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry

Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty

The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease

Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS

""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldn't recognise me, but I'd also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldn't recognise me.

""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties.""

Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe.

She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese.

For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive.

Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years

""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says.

But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments.

Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum.

For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea

Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through.

There is no doubt that for some it's highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be.

It's not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating.

For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat.

Other treatments are more radical.

In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse.

If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea.

Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food.

It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight.

People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life.

The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it.

Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change?

Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive?

""They don't necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says.

""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself.""

Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

Manchester riots: Doughnut thief jailed for 16 months,A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre is jailed for 16 months.,[],None,"Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobacco

A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months.

Thomas Downey, 48, was released from HMP Manchester on 9 August shortly before getting caught up in the riots.

The serial offender went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous before downing a bottle of sherry and stumbling into Krispy Kreme in Piccadilly Gardens.

He was caught with a box of doughnuts when 20 riot officers arrived.

Downey admitted burglary and breach of an Asbo by entering part of the city centre from which he is prohibited.

Judge Robert Atherton, sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, told him: ""You drink too much, too regularly and when in drink become threatening and abusive.""

'Expressed remorse'

The total cost of damage to the shop - which was unsecured before Downey went in for the doughnuts - was about £17,000, prosecutors said.

The court heard he had more than 100 convictions for 233 offences and had been released from prison at 19:30 BST that day.

Zoe Nield, for Downey, said her client had left jail with only £4 in his pocket.

He was not involved in rioting but took the doughnuts because he was hungry, having spent his money on tobacco, she said.

She added: ""He can't recall the events because he was drunk but he has expressed remorse.""

Among the others to be sentenced was David Swarbrick, 25, was jailed for two years after he stole £25 worth of Oil of Olay from a Quality Save store in Parker Street, which was unsecured after an earlier attack.

'Thrown away'

Swarbrick, of Aston Old Road, Openshaw, admitted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence order.

Father-of-four Anthony Winder, 38, looted the Swarovski Crystal store and smashed a display cabinet to get an ornamental dog, the court heard.

He was also jailed for two years. The judge told him he had ""made a highly respectable life"" for himself and his family, despite a difficult childhood.

""You should have been at the forefront of leading people away from such activities but you became involved,"" the judge said.

Dr Anand Hiremath, 41, who worked at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, was found dead by his wife, with two syringes near his body.

Coroner Alan Crickmore recorded a verdict of suicide.

He said fears of the likely loss of his job and money worries had contributed to his ""despondent frame of mind"".

The inquest in Gloucester was told Dr Hiremath feared being struck off and was worried about an impending tax bill.

Dr Hiremath, a father-of-two, had been given a final written warning and his progress was being monitored by the General Medical Council (GMC).

He was also told to attend Alcoholics Anonymous and give up working at two private hospitals during his recovery.

Speaking after the case, a GMC spokeswoman said: ""No doctor will be erased for disciplinary reasons where their impairment relates purely to their ill-health.

"When the US president travels, the world stands still",Life in a security bubble is necessary for the president – and claustrophobic. Here’s an insider’s account.,"['Tara Mckelvey', 'White House Reporter']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Not quite a simple walk in the park when Dad is the president of the United States

US President Barack Obama pines for the moment when he can leave the security bubble. After 24 hours inside it, I can see why.

Mr Obama and his daughter Sasha, 14, walk across a tarmac in New York on Friday. He taps her shoulder and points towards Manhattan, showing her the world, or at least his version of it.

What a place.

They fly on Air Force One to one of New York's airports - and minutes later arrive by helicopter in Manhattan.

Streets are blocked off, and their motorcade glides to the Upper East Side. They run red lights - at least 26 over the weekend. Along the way people cheer. At one point a woman in a flowery sundress holds up a handmade sign: ""FREE HUGS"".

It's a New York fantasy, one of the perks of Mr Obama's job. He travels in a security zone, a ""bubble"" as it's known - a tightly managed network of aircrafts, vehicles and communication that lets him move easily around the world.

Image caption At a briefing Mr Obama says he likes to travel when he's free to go where he wants

The bubble provides safety, but it's confining. In a recent briefing he sounded wistful about an upcoming trip to Kenya, his father's homeland. He made it clear he'd rather go without security restrictions.

""I'll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said. ""Because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference centre.""

He still has 18 months left in the bubble, though. For that reason it's worth looking at the experience - and considering what it means in terms of his worldview.

The presidential bubble is thick - and pricey. Mr Obama rides in the motorcade in a limousine known as the Beast, which is designed to withstand bullets and chemical attacks.

Mr Obama flies on a Boeing 747 jet that costs $180,000 (£116,000) per hour to operate - and can be refuelled in the middle of a flight. Electronic equipment on board is designed to withstand all kinds of duress, including force from an electromagnetic pulse, according to White House officials.

On the aircraft Mr Obama has a suite with its own bathroom, as well as an office and a conference room. He has access to classified material, and he can communicate with military officials if the US is under attack or is facing another kind of emergency.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Obama shows his daughter around New York - under tight security

There is a saying in the UK that everything smells like fresh paint to the Queen because wherever she goes, things are done up. Here in the US presidents are treated like royalty.

When you climb onto Air Force One, it smells like leather. The seats are business-class sized, even in the back.

I'm a new ""supplementary"" member of the ""travel pool"", a group of journalists who accompany Mr Obama on trips so they can report on what's euphemistically known as a ""transformative moment"" - for example, if the president gets shot. It also gives reporters a chance to experience in a visceral way presidential life on the road.

As we get settled, a flight attendant brings out cool white towels and a basket with grapes, bananas and oranges.

Almond Joy and Baby Ruth candy bars are displayed on a table near a row of magazines in white binders. I put a box of M&M's with a presidential seal in my bag.

Two cameramen watch golf on television. ""Atlantic City,"" says one, looking out of the window. ""It's much cleaner from up here.""

Everything in the bubble, including the Jersey shore, looks scrubbed.

Even my colleagues and I are ""clean"", since we've been ""wanded"" (swept by hand-held metal detectors) and inspected by bomb-sniffing German shepherds.

Once you're in the bubble, you can't chat with those who aren't ""clean"".

Image copyright AFP

This keeps the president safe. It also cuts you off from the world - and shows the cloistered nature of the one he inhabits.

Mr Obama has to stoop slightly when he gets on board the helicopter in New York so he doesn't bump his head.

Afterwards my colleagues and I head across the tarmac to an Osprey aircraft, propellers spinning.

The gusts of air are hot and fierce, and I almost lose my footing. The aircraft shakes in the air, and you can feel it vibrate in your throat. I see a red buoy in churning water, like a fragment from a Turner painting, and we fly over South Street Seaport.

FDR Drive on the east side of Manhattan is closed down for our motorcade. Traffic is blocked for miles.

""Wave like the queen,"" a friend in Boston had advised me.

Police line the streets on the Upper East Side, where Mr Obama attends a Democratic fundraiser. Nearby a mailbox has a padlock and a red sign: ""This collection box has been locked."" This makes it harder to stuff it with explosives.

Image caption In New York Mr Obama is protected by police officers - and dump trucks

In other places, dump trucks block the streets. Gravel is piled in the back of one truck marked ""sanitation"".

The following morning the president is chewing gum on a walk near Central Park's Sheep Meadow. ""We love you, Obama,"" someone calls out.

Secret Service officers wade through the grass, checking for bombs and assassins.

Afterwards Mr Obama goes to a Broadway play.

No charges over Mel Gibson leak,,[],2009-10-09 09:33:33,"Mel Gibson's police photograph from his 2006 arrest

The Los Angeles police officer accused of leaking information over the 2006 arrest of actor Mel Gibson three years ago will not face charges.

Prosecutors say there is lack of proof that Deputy Sheriff James Mee disclosed details of his report about the film star's drink-driving arrest.

Mr Mee was suspected of having leaked reports of Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade, deemed criminal by prosecutors.

The star's conviction for drink-driving was erased on Wednesday.

It followed the star's successful completion of the terms of his probation.

The actor had been ordered to perform public service work and attend Alcoholics Anonymous for three years.

Rant

The celebrity website TMZ first posted details about Gibson's tirade to the arresting officer in California, who was Jewish.

It was picked up across the media and the actor apologised a number of times saying the comments did not reflect his true feelings.

A report into how the information was released said prosecutors found the leaks were criminal, but could not be linked to Mr Mee.

It showed investigators found calls between Mee's home and TMZ's founder Harvey Levin but they could not tell who made the calls at Mr Mee's end.

Levin told investigators he had not paid anyone at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for the information.

Prosecutors also reviewed Mr Mee's financial records and found no improper payments.

The report also reveals that Mr Mee's superiors made him rewrite his initial report, taking out details of Gibson's rant. That information was then put into an extra report.

Gibson, who repeatedly apologised for making the comments, is required to be monitored by the courts to ensure he is adhering to the conditions of his three years' probation.

A lot of bottle,,['Denise Winterman'],2005-05-12 10:20:54,"By Denise Winterman

BBC News Magazine



Even Alcoholics Anonymous describes its two founders as ""hopeless"" drunks.

New York stockbroker Bill Wilson and Ohio surgeon Bob Smith were both battling the bottle when they met through a church group in 1935.

After fighting his own addiction, Wilson helped Smith kick his, and together they devised the now famous 12-step programme that is the foundation of AA's approach. With a strong spiritual message, it asks people to acknowledge their powerlessness over alcohol, turn to a higher power - whatever they believe that to be - and take specific steps to change.

AA is not without it critics, some of whom have likened it to a cult, but few argue that it hasn't helped millions of alcoholics worldwide. So is it the answer to the battle with the bottle?

THE REGULAR

""Where I come from there is a strong drinking culture and going to the pub every day is not considered unusual. But when you start spending all your money on drink and put it before your family, you know you have a problem.""

He finally decided to stop drinking when his wife walked out and took their children. Knowing he wanted to change but not knowing how to live his life without drink, he went to AA. ""It taught me how to tackle each day without drink.

""Just as people's moods change daily, so does my attitude to alcohol. I can go for months without wanting a drink and then have a bad day. If I don't do the 12-steps programme, I'm unlikely to stay sober. AA is a lifelong commitment for me.""

He says the network of AA meetings and sponsor system - whereby individuals help each other - means he can always get support, even on holiday in Spain last year. ""I couldn't have given up the booze without that support. Alcoholics come in all shapes and sizes but we are fighting the same disease and only another alcoholic knows how hard that is,"" he says.

THE NEWCOMER

He says he thought it would be full of broken-down old drunks, not young professionals like himself, but was wrong. ""At my first meeting I realised there were a lot of people like me and I could identify with what they were saying. It became a lot easier for me to see there was another way of living that didn't involve pubs, clubs and drinking.""

Jason tried counselling several times over the years but it didn't help. ""I found it very isolating and vague,"" he says. ""I need more direction and interaction and AA gives you both. It has given me a lot of insight and self awareness. Through the 12-step programme I have gone back and looked at my life and relationships.""

It has made him more honest with himself and family and friends, he says.

""I am not your stereotypical alcoholic but at AA it doesn't matter how much you drink, what you drink or where - just as long as you want to give up.""

THE PROFESSIONAL

""This is an unalloyed good thing and I praise them for it. You can go to any city anywhere and walk into a meeting regardless of race, class or creed,"" he says.

But this makes it more of a spiritual or semi-religious movement, less a therapeutic response.

""In the 12-step programme of AA, there is always an emphasis on a 'higher power' and the sufferer's 'personal incapability'. This is really in conflict with the underlying values of psychotherapy where the client is assumed to have sufficient resources of internal self-recovery without inventing an external metaphysical universe.""

Hodson also believes the lack of help elsewhere has contributed to its success.

""There is little competition - who else can you turn to?"" he says.

THE CRITICS

Psychologist and lawyer Stanton Peele - author of Resisting 12-Step Coercion - takes issue with the message that addiction is an incurable disease and that while alcoholics can become sober, they remain alcoholics and should stay in AA.

What about an 18-year-old drinking too much on weekends, he asks. Would the best approach be to convince him he has a lifelong disease?

Mr Hodson says the 12 steps are not the only way of dealing with addictive behaviour.

""It does rather assume that alcoholism is a disease,"" he says, ""instead of a set of accountable familial tendencies resulting in poor behavioural choices.""","['day', 'drink', 'bottle', 'disease', 'help', 'programme', 'lot', '12step', 'aa', 'alcoholics', 'drinking']","New York stockbroker Bill Wilson and Ohio surgeon Bob Smith were both battling the bottle when they met through a church group in 1935.

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,"The Bishop of Stafford hits out at the government for ""doing little"" to address the problem of alcohol abuse.",[],None,"Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"".

Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking.

The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures.

He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough.

'Major sin'

In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time.

It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka.

In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of 'sin' is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be.

""Alcohol abuse is one of the major 'sins' of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent.

""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational O'Connor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse.""

'Drink at home'

""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours.

""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas.

""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop.

""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory.""

A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences.

""And we haven't just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, we've taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.","['source', 'unveiled', 'stafford', 'tackling', 'accuses', 'minimum', 'alcohol', 'set', 'bishop', 'spokesman', 'crime', 'price', 'tackle', 'abuse']","Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

Polish embassy 'funded far-right speakers' at UK event,"The book fair in Slough included speakers well-known for promoting hate speech, BBC Newsnight found.","['Nawal Al-Maghafi', 'Maya Rostowska', 'Bbc Newsnight']",None,"Image copyright Screen grab from wREalu24 Image caption The Slough book fair in 2017 featured prominent far-right Polish speakers like Marcin Rola (pictured second from the right)

The Polish Embassy in London part-funded an event that gave a platform to right-wing extremists in the UK, a BBC Newsnight investigation has found.

The embassy helped to finance a book fair in Slough in 2017, which included speakers from Poland well-known for promoting hate speech in their country.

Experts have questioned whether such speakers should be allowed into the UK.

The embassy says it funded the event after ""appropriate assessment"" by Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The embassy confirmed to Newsnight that funding it provided to the Slough Book Fair paid for speakers' accommodation in Britain.

One of the speakers at the Slough event was Marcin Rola, who moderated the discussion and runs a far-right online TV station in Poland, Wrealu24, which has more than 140,000 subscribers on YouTube.

In a recent broadcast, Rola told his viewers that Sweden is ""top of the league table in terms of rapes by Muslim immigrant-invaders on women. On everyone. On animals, on holes in the fence. Because, well, we all know how they behave"".

In the UK, many of Mr Rola's statements would qualify as hate speech. He has told viewers that ""in Islam, paedophilia is their daily bread"" and refers to Muslims as ""savages"".

'Out of context'

When Newsnight questioned Mr Rola about his rhetoric, he said his comments were ""taken out of context"".

Although he admitted that calling Muslims ""savages"" was ""quite harsh,"" he ""stood by"" his comments, as he said they were in the context of discussing grooming gangs.

The Slough Book Fair was organised by a UK-based chapter of far-right group Polska Niepodlegla.

It was also behind a fun run in February 2017, at which it had hoped to host Jacek Miedlar, a former priest well-known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric.

Miedlar was unable to attend the fun run when he was prevented from entering Britain. He was again stopped from coming into the country in June, when he was hoping to attend a Britain First rally in Birmingham.

Asked about the Slough Book Fair, the Polish Embassy told Newsnight that it had funded the event after ""an appropriate assessment and receiving acceptance according to the regulations specifying the use of MFA budget funds"".

However, Michal Garapich, who has been studying Polish migration in the UK for more than a decade, says that although the membership of far-right groups in the UK is quite small, the ones that exist are feeling stronger.

""There are definitely more Polish Jehovah's Witnesses or Polish members of AA (Alcohol Anonymous) groups than there are far-right nationalists who organise themselves. But they have momentum now.

""They are emboldened, they are more assertive.""

Political oxygen

Mr Garapich links the new assertiveness of the Polish far right to the change of government in Poland.

He says the ruling party, Law and Justice, gives ""nationalist, far right, sometimes fascist groups quite a lot of political oxygen, a lot of exposure, and even access to public funds"".

Fiyaz Mughal, from the anti-extremism organisation Faith Matters, says events like the Slough Book Fair form part of an attempt by the far right to gain a foothold among Poles in Britain.

By holding events like book fairs and fun runs, extremist groups ""inject their intolerance, their bigotry, and their prejudice into these communities"", he added.

""Let's call it what it is. It's a form of radicalisation.""

Mr Rola, the moderator of the Slough discussion, came back to the UK in June to attend another edition of the book fair - this time in Leeds.

This one was not funded by the Polish Embassy but was organised by the same group, Polska Niepodlegla.

As soon as he reached arrivals at Luton Airport, he tweeted a photograph captioned: ""They didn't even frisk us.""

Asked about Mr Rola's case, the Home Office refused to comment.

A spokesman said the government is ""taking a comprehensive approach to defeat the scourge of extremism by supporting communities to promote our common values and confront extremism wherever it exists"".

Rapist Robert Foye has minimum prison sentence halved,A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.,[],None,"Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prison

A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.

Robert Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years over the attack on the 16-year-old in August 2007.

However, minimum sentencing guidelines were changed following successful appeals earlier this year by Foye and paedophile Morris Petch.

Under new guidelines for discretionary life sentences, Foye, 32, will serve a minimum of four-and-a-half years.

Scottish Conservative justice spokesman John Lamont said the public would be ""aghast"" at the decision.

Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Johann Lamont said the public would be ""horrified"" that Foye could be considered for parole after such a short time in prison.

'Appalling crime'

Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he planned to bring forward changes in the law this year which would address the issues raised in the judgement.

""I respect the decision of the court - but I am aware that many people will be concerned that the minimum punishment part in this case has been reduced,"" he said.

""It was a truly appalling crime that Robert Foye committed.""

Following his conviction, Foye's defence lawyer appealed against the way trial judge Lady Smith had arrived at her decision on the minimum jail term to be served.

In March, following an appeal by Foye and Petch, judges overruled previous guidelines for setting the punishment part of discretionary life sentences and orders for lifelong restriction.

After hearing Foye's appeal, based on the revised guidelines, judges Lord Osborne, sitting with Lords Woolman and Wheatley said he can now make a bid for release after serving four-and-a-half years.

Guilty plea

In the written ruling, Lord Osborne said it may be of some comfort to those concerned that, after that time, Foye would only be freed if the parole board were satisfied he no longer posed a threat to the public.

Orders for lifelong restriction (OLR) - the kind of life sentence imposed on Foye in October 2008 - were introduced five years ago.

Since then, no prisoner given an OLR has been freed, no matter how short their so-called punishment part, or minimum sentence.

Foye, who admitted raping the schoolgirl, had been on the run for almost a week when he carried out the attack.

He had been allowed out of Castle Huntly open prison, near Dundee, to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Foye, then 28, had lived rough in woods, drinking heavily, before he seized the girl in broad daylight as she returned from Cumbernauld town centre after collecting new contact lenses on 24 August 2007.

It later emerged that Foye had absconded from the open prison on a previous occasion in 2005.","['appeal', 'foye', 'punishment', 'sentence', 'guidelines', 'minimum', 'life', 'schoolgirl', 'prison', 'short', 'rapist', 'robert', 'run', 'halved']","Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prisonA man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.

Obituary: Dora Bryan,"Dora Bryan, who has died 91, was a talented character actress who played everything from Ibsen to Absolutely Fabulous.",[],None,"Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicals

Dora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

The variety of the roles she played, including parts in plays by Ibsen and Pinter, belied her caricature as a wide-eyed dizzy blonde.

Born Dora May Broadbent in Southport, Lancashire in 1924, she went to a council school and, encouraged by her ambitious mother, made her first stage appearance at the age of 12, in pantomime in Manchester.

Image caption Bryan recorded the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh with Nicholas Parsons (far right)

During World War 2 she worked in repertory theatre and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) - an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the war.

She moved to London in 1945 and appeared in a number of West End productions - notably in the Lyric and Globe revues in the 1950s.

Image caption In 2000, Bryan joined the cast of Last of the Summer Wine but left five years later

She changed her name to Bryan, taking it from the match manufacturers Bryant and May. She lost the closing ""t"" when a theatre programme misspelled her name.

In 1966, the actress played the title role in Hello, Dolly at Drury Lane, eating a full chicken dinner on stage six nights a week and at two matinees.

In 1968 she played nine parts as the star of They Don't Grow on Trees at the Prince of Wales.

Later, she was in the National Theatre's She Stoops to Conquer (for which she won an award) and a revival of Charlie Girl. And she took the West End by storm in a lavish 2002 musical production of The Full Monty.

Speaking to Michael Parkinson on Desert Island Discs in 1987, she said musical theatre had always held a special place in her heart.

""I was in rep for seven years and to get a marvellous part in a play is great, it really is super, particularly if it's a funny part and there is nothing like making an audience laugh.

""But with musicals, I like the atmosphere backstage. You go backstage in a real theatre, in a real plush and gilt theatre and you can shout to the dressing room opposite you and you're all clustered in together, you get a real theatrical atmosphere.""

Her theatre career was crowned with a prestigious Olivier award in recognition of her role, as Meg, in a National Theatre production of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.

Ab Fab

But she was not just a stage actress - she made her big screen debut in 1948's The Fallen Idol. About 40 further films followed, including The Blue Lamp, The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery, The Sandwich Man and Two a Penny.

The peak of her career came as she played the domineering, promiscuous, alcoholic mother, Helen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey. The role won her a Bafta award for best actress.

Image caption In 1994, she was cast in the play Bed, which presented a vast dreamscape of seven very old people - all of whom share the same vast bed

Image caption Bryan and June Whitfield acted together in the fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous

On television, she appeared in According to Dora and Both Ends Meet and, latterly, she joined a star-studded cast in Last of the Summer Wine.

In an interview with the Church Times in 2006, she said: ""I got my part as Roz in Last of the Summer Wine through Thora Hird. We had always been friends, and always nattered on about the old days.

""We knew actors most people have now forgotten. Then, a few years ago, she suddenly said: 'I wish you were in it with me.'""

Image caption Among Bryan's numerous TV appearances was an episode of Casualty

She also brought the house down with a recurring cameo role in Absolutely Fabulous as June Whitfield's on-screen friend Dolly.

This is Your Life

Dora Bryan was also in the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh. And she once made a novelty record, All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle, which became an unexpected hit.

However her life was also touched by tragedy.

Her adopted daughter Georgina died from alcoholism, her son Daniel endured a debilitating illness and she herself experienced alcoholism.

She told the Church Times she was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""I got very lonely on tour,"" she said, ""and used to order room-service with a bottle of wine, which was not the answer. I don't miss it at all, and just enjoy coffee or tea.""

Bryan's husband, Lancashire County Cricketer Bill Lawton, died from Alzheimer's in 2008 and Dora, in her later years, became unable to work, as short-term memory loss affected her ability to learn lines.

She was honoured twice by TV tribute show This Is Your Life, in 1962 and again in 1989.

In her book, According to Dora, she remembered her first appearance.

""I was hoping the BBC would have filmed a message from my brother John in South Africa. It never occurred to me that they would have gone to all the trouble and expense of flying him from Cape Town, and I must admit that when he walked on to the stage with his wife Marguerite, I cried a little from sheer happiness.""

On her second appearance, host Eamonn Andrews ""ambushed"" the actress in her living room, before whisking her to the TV studio to hear tributes from her friends and family.

""Tonight?"" exclaimed the star. ""Oh dear! I've got to do some auditions at four!""

Her final film appearance was in Gone to the Dogs (2006) opposite Anthony Booth.

On-the-run rapist absconded twice,,[],2008-02-22 12:05:03,"Robert Foye had absconded from Castle Huntly on two occasions

Foye arrives at court

Robert Foye, 28, admitted raping the 16-year-old in Cumbernauld in August, 2006 while serving a 10-year sentence for attempting to murder a detective.

Lady Smith said Foye had previously absconded from Castle Huntly in 2005.

The judge said he will be sentenced on 6 May and told him she was considering a life-long restriction order.

Lady Smith said Foye had been assessed as posing ""a very high risk of further violent offending"".

Urgent review

She called for a full report from a psychologist accredited by the Risk Management Authority.

The court heard Foye had promised not to abscond again and had tested positive for drugs before absconding for a second time.

Foye was allowed out of Castle Huntly, near Dundee, to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting but did not return.

He admitted raping the girl - six days later - on 24 August on a path near Dowanfield Road, Cumbernauld.

In January, Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced that an urgent review would be carried out to see what lessons could be learned.

Paul Gascoigne given suspended drink-driving sentence,Former footballer Paul Gascoigne is given an eight-week suspended sentence after admitting driving while over the legal alcohol limit.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Gascoigne arriving at Newcastle Magistrates' Court for sentencing

Former footballer Paul Gascoigne has been given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted drinking and driving.

The 43-year-old Tyneside-born former England midfielder was stopped by police in Newcastle on 8 October.

The city's magistrates' court was told that Gascoigne was more than four times the legal alcohol limit.

He was handed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, and banned from driving for three years. He was also given an alcohol treatment order.

The court was told Gascoigne was five weeks into a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset.

Gascoigne, who played top flight football for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough in a career spanning nearly 20 years, also attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

I hope not to see you again District Judge Stephen Earl Profile: Paul Gascoigne

His solicitor Stephen Andrews said: ""The talk now is of an extensive and elongated period of support while not actually under the roof of the Providence Project, but certainly within easy reach, given the continued support they would propose to offer.

""Previously, it has been on his terms. He's gone in, he has used it as he saw fit and of course relapsed because he has not done the full programme.

""This time it has been on their terms.""

District Judge Stephen Earl said he believed a 12-week sentence, with a third off as credit for a guilty plea, was appropriate.

He said the sentence was suspended in recognition of Gascoigne's progress in the treatment programme.

'Toon Army'

He warned the former footballer that if he re-offended in the next 12 months, the jail term would be triggered.

District Judge Earl added: ""I hope not to see you again.""

Gascoigne made no comment when he left court, but Mr Andrews said he was relieved and that it was a ""good result"".

Outside the court well-wishers shouted, ""Toon Army never surrenders"", and he signed autographs for fans.

He then got into his lawyer's car which became stuck in heavy snow in the car park behind the court.

The vehicle - which sported a Manchester City pendant on the passenger window - was pushed free by members of the press.

Gascoigne is also due to be tried on a separate charge of drinking and driving, which he denies.

Lohan, who has starred in films including Mean Girls and The Parent Trap, admitted in December that she had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Her frequent partying and drunken exits from nightclubs were a fixture of tabloid newspapers in 2006.

In July, Morgan Creek Productions chief executive James G Robinson sent a letter to the actress rebuking her for arriving late on set for the film Georgia Rule, suggesting ""heavy partying"" was to blame.

HBO boss resigns following arrest,,[],2007-05-10 08:51:34,"Chris Albrecht was arrested early on Sunday morning

Mr Albrecht was arrested on Sunday in Las Vegas when police reported seeing him assaulting a woman outside the MGM Grand after watching a boxing match.

On Tuesday he said that he was taking a leave of absence to deal with a recurring problem with alcohol.

Mr Albrecht said he was stepping down ""at the request of Time Warner"".

Earlier settlement

""I had been a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 13 years,"" he added in a statement.

""Two years ago I decided that I could handle drinking again. Clearly I was wrong.""

The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that HBO had paid a settlement of at least $400,000 (£200,870) in 1991 to a subordinate and former lover of Mr Albrecht who alleged that he had shoved and choked her.

HBO is a pay-TV network owned by the US media giant Time Warner.

Gibson told to attend AA meetings,,[],2006-08-18 08:27:55,"Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks caused a media furore

The Oscar-winning director was given three years' probation, California officials said.

He did not appear at the hearing but entered the plea through his lawyer, the district attorney's office said.

During his arrest, Gibson made what he has said were ""harmful"" anti-Semitic comments. He subsequently apologised.

Gibson said he had suffered a relapse in his battle with alcoholism.

He was arrested on 28 July after being seen driving at 87mph (139km/h) on a 45mph (72km/h) stretch of Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway, the local sheriff's department said.

Court deal

Gibson pleaded no contest to driving with excess alcohol in his blood.

But in a deal with the court, two other charges - driving under the influence and having an open bottle of tequila in his car - were both dropped.

Gibson was stopped on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu

A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt, but for sentencing purposes it is equivalent to a guilty plea.

Authorities said his blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.12%. The legal limit in California is 0.08%.

Gibson was ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five times a week for four-and-a-half months, and then three per week for a further seven-and-a-half months.

The actor also has to complete a three-month alcohol education and counselling programme for first-time offenders.

Public information film

Gibson had also volunteered to appear in a public information film on the hazards of drink-driving, but that was not made a condition of his sentence.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca has so far denied the media access to audio and video tapes of Gibson's arrest on the grounds that they are part of an ""investigatory file"" and exempt from public records laws.

The issue arose because a sheriff's spokesman said Gibson's arrest occurred ""without incident"", and made no mention of the anti-Semitic remarks.

Asked whether the tapes would be released, Mr Baca said: ""I'm looking at that right now - I've got to go back and look at everything that was there.""

Gibson, 50, is due back in court for a progress report in January.

He won a best director Oscar for his 1995 film Braveheart, in which he also starred.

His 2004 biblical epic, The Passion of the Christ, was recently named the most controversial movie to date by US magazine Entertainment Weekly.","['sheriffs', 'gibsons', 'public', 'pacific', 'gibson', 'meetings', 'antisemitic', 'aa', 'driving', 'arrest', 'plea', 'attend', 'tapes', 'told', 'week']","Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks caused a media furoreThe Oscar-winning director was given three years' probation, California officials said.

Prisoner on run raped schoolgirl,,[],2008-01-23 13:41:00,"Robert Foye was sentenced to 10 years in 2002

Robert Foye, 28, admitted raping the 16-year-old girl in Cumbernauld in August last year.

The court heard he was allowed out of Castle Huntly to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting but did not return.

At the High Court in Glasgow, Lady Smith said it was an appalling crime. Foye will be sentenced next month.

He attacked his victim six days after absconding from Castle Huntly, near Dundee.

'Distressing and upsetting'

The court heard he had been living rough in woods.

Paul McBride QC said no right thinking person, including the accused, would have anything but ""revulsion"" for the crime and sympathy for the victim.

""He is appalled at what he has done,"" said Mr McBride.

Foye admitted raping the girl on 24 August on a path near Dowanfield Road, Cumbernauld.

He was arrested a day after the attack and samples from the victim matched his DNA profile.

Jennifer Bain, prosecuting, said the victim, who was in court, was attending counselling.

She said the attack had impacted on the teenager's schooling.

Lady Smith said the girl's victim impact statement was written in ""distressing and upsetting terms"".

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,"['Justin Parkinson', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent

The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style.

He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.""

The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt.

Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011.

Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark.

The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community.

Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""?

""It's very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You don't get enough of people admitting when they've done something wrong, particularly in the workplace.""

Image copyright Reuters

Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarez's culpability and ongoing problem.

""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said he'd done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. What's happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in people's estimation. The timing is absolutely key.""

Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECB's own announcement.

Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so.""

Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches.

In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"".

Sacked as captain four days later when he changed his story and admitted taking money to provide information to gambling interests

Banned from cricket for life in June 2000

Died in plane crash in South Africa's Western Cape in 2002

The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the world's media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent.

""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.

""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in.""

Could Vincent's more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket?

""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. It's best just to come out and say it.""

The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot.

But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincent's statement comes across like it's personal,"" he says. ""That's good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesn't sound like that. It's not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice.

""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. He'll have to do something to show he's trying to make a difference and he's truly changed his ways.""

Attitudes to alcohol questioned,,[],2009-03-26 17:49:43,"by Philippa

School Reporter, The Vyne School, Basingstoke

Why do teenagers get so much stick for drinking alcohol? We asked Year 9 students (13-14), at The Vyne School, to complete a questionnaire about how much they drink. In the UK, there is a minimum age - 18 - that you can buy alcohol, but the minimum age of when you can drink alcohol is five. So it must be perfectly fine to drink when you're over five then? Teenage drinking is not decreasing In our questionnaire we asked: ""Are you aware of the effects alcohol can have on you?"" Eighteen per cent claimed: ""I don't care"" about the effects,"" while 44% of people said: ""Yes, I am aware, but I drink anyway."" But because all these people are over five, how can they really be in the wrong? Another question we asked was: ""Why do you drink?"" Thirty per cent say they don't drink, 5% considered themselves to be ""addicted"" to drink and 15% of the participants drank for ""popularity"". Many teenagers obviously think that is it ""cool"" to drink just so that they can get in with ""The Popular Crowd"". In Europe, Britain has the third highest underage drinking rate. Is this because we are so strict on the legal age to buy alcohol? In other European countries, lower age restrictions to purchase alcohol apply. For example, Germany's legal drinking age is 16 whereas in countries like Portugal and Poland, there is no minimum age to when you can start drinking. How do we tackle drinking here in the UK? Well, all that seems to happen is that another law comes in here and another law comes in there but that clearly isn't having an effect. It seems, that the more laws come in to action, the more drinking grows in appeal. Perhaps, if we had no minimum drinking age (as do Poland) then maybe the novelty will wear off, seeing as they are no longer breaking the law. If you want help with your alcohol problems you can call Alcoholics Anonymous on 0845 769 7555

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.","['Andy Gill', 'Bbc North West Tonight']",None,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good

""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir.

The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool.

They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that they've been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours.

Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people.

But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role.

Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence.

'Animal existence'

Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK.

And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse.

In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency

More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664.

But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time.

In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin.

Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles.

To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments.

Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts.

Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17.

""I'd have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence.""

Now, being in the choir is vital for him.

""I love it,"" he said. ""It's really positive for me.""

Children of addicts

The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time.

Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme

It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK.

Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week.

It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England.

Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe.""

Liverpool was where the UK's first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink.

But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles.

Some don't like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment.

Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats.""

But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves.

""If you get this right, you're the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said.

Drunk aristocrat gets drive ban,,[],2009-02-11 14:58:16,"The court heard that Bovill had been on her way to a dry-out clinic An aristocratic artist has been banned from driving for 30 months and fined £800 after trying to drive hundreds of miles to a rehab clinic while drunk. Katrina Bovill, 36, drove for about four hours before she was stopped by police north of Perth and was found to be nearly four times the alcohol limit. She had drunk vodka and whisky before leaving Skye to go to her appointment at the clinic in London. Bovill also admitted driving while banned and without insurance. Bovill, whose brother-in-law is the Earl of Hopetoun, had a reading of 127 mics when she was caught on the A9 on 25 May last year. The legal limit is 35 mics. She was already serving a six-month ban handed down in January 2008 for a series of speeding offences. 'Tremendous pressure' Solicitor Gordon Innes, defending, told the court that a driving ban would affect her career because she would be unable to go out and paint landscapes. He said: ""She is a professional artist who resides in London. For a number of years she has felt under tremendous pressure and has resorted over the past few years to using alcohol to relieve that pressure. ""She came to a very abrupt halt in her lifestyle with this offence."" He said she had been in detox virtually ever since, including several months at a clinic in South Africa, and was also attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Mr Innes showed the court examples of her work and described her as ""quite well-renowned"". ""Her career was able to provide her with a reasonable standard of living. She had saved around £30,000 all of which has gone in relation to her intensive therapy and care work,"" he said. ""She appreciates the seriousness of the offences and she was disqualified at the time.""

Mel Gibson says he survived 'public humiliation',,[],2010-01-20 11:57:31,"Gibson presented the best director award at Sunday's Golden Globes Mel Gibson says he has been made stronger by the ""public humiliation"" of his drink-drive arrest in 2006. Gibson's arrest sparked outrage after a leaked police report quoted him making anti-Semitic comments to the arresting officer in California, who was Jewish. ""You ask anybody what their number one fear is and it's public humiliation,"" he told the UK's Mirror newspaper. ""Multiply that on a global scale and that's what I've been through. It changes you,"" he added. But the Lethal Weapon star was philosophical about his troubles, saying: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's really that simple.""

Mexico argument Gibson's conviction for drink-driving was erased last October, after he successfully completed probation. The actor had been ordered to perform public service work and attend Alcoholics Anonymous for three years. He has reportedly given up drinking entirely since his arrest. But Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais made a dig at his expense during Sunday night's award ceremony, joking: ""I like a drink as much as the next man... unless the next man is Mel Gibson."" The 54-year-old took it in his stride, pretending to slur his words as he took to the stage to present the best director prize. Gibson will return to UK cinemas later this month, playing his first on-screen role in eight years, in political thriller Edge Of Darkness. The star, who won a best director Oscar in 1995 for Braveheart, is also preparing to film his own screenplay, How I Spent My Summer Vacation, in Mexico. The movie, which tells the story of a career criminal who is arrested and placed in a tough prison, has caused upset in Mexico after plans were announced to move inmates from a real-life prison to allow filming to take place. Hundreds of people demonstrated outside the Ignacio Allende prison in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz after learning their relatives would be transferred, making visits more difficult. Gibson told the Mirror he had not requested the prison to be emptied. ""No-one asked for them to be transferred,"" he said. ""It was a decision by the Mexican authorities.""

Michael Le Vell: Street star's 'demons' laid bare in trial,"Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell is cleared of child sex offences, but his trial revealed the darker side of his personal life.",[],None,"Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week. On the steps of the court, after the jury had found him not guilty of 12 charges, his relief was obvious.

""I might go and have a drink now, believe it or not,"" was how Mr Le Vell finished his brief statement to the gathered media.

It was a remark that raised a laugh with his supporters but, as had been clear in the trial, it pointed to a dark side of the star's private life.

The 48-year-old actor, tried under his real name Michael Turner, had confessed his inner demons - alcoholism and adultery - during his time in the witness box.

'Troubled life'

The indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Nigel Pivaro, Ex-Coronation Street actor

However, the star who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap maintained throughout he had never sexually assaulted or raped a child.

The judge had warned jurors not to confuse the man in the dock with his TV role as the car mechanic he has played for 30 years, watched by nine million viewers a week.

Mr Le Vell told the court his role had allowed him to live a ""luxury, charmed"" existence, but that on-screen fame hid what prosecutors said was a ""troubled"" life.

During cross-examination, he admitted he was an alcoholic and for 30 years had been ""drinking about seven or eight pints a night"" in the pub.

He told the court he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous ""one or two times"" but had given up on each occasion after just a few weeks.

In court, Mr Le Vell claimed his drinking was the result of his ""working-class mentality"" and confessed he had only been able to continue acting because his job had ""cocooned"" him.

'One-night stands'

The verdict came at the end of a trial which had seen the prosecutor remind the jury the case concerned neither Coronation Street's Kevin Webster nor Michael Le Vell.

Image caption Mr Le Vell has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the popular soap since 1983

""The man on trial is Michael Turner,"" chief prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said.

During his trial, the jury heard how Mr Le Vell had cheated on his wife while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, in a parallel with his on-screen character, and he had had a string of one-night stands.

By coincidence, his character Kevin Webster had an affair with a character called Molly Dobbs while his on-screen wife, Sally Webster, developed breast cancer.

Such plot developments came a long time after Mr Turner started acting at school, aged 12, later becoming a member of Oldham Theatre Workshop, adopting the stage name of Le Vell along the way.

In 1981, he got his break, joining Coronation Street in a minor role for a few episodes. Two years later, he was cast as mechanic Kevin Webster.

As producers sought to win younger audiences Kevin and his two mates - bad-boy Terry Duckworth (played by Nigel Pivaro) and dreamer with intellectual pretensions Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) became a hit with fans.

Star's personal drama

Only Mr Le Vell has lasted in ""The Street"" and fans of the soap opera have followed his stormy relationship with Sally, played by Sally Dynevor.

Image caption Mr Le Vell's trial lasted seven days and ended with his acquittal on all charges

Such was his prominence, he had a major part in 2010's live 50th anniversary episode, which featured a fatal tram crash in Weatherfield, with his performance leading to a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Within months of that on-screen drama though, Mr Le Vell was dealing with his own crisis as he was arrested over child sex allegations.

He ""strenuously"" denied the claims and, after considering the case, the Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to bring charges against him, in January 2012.

At the time, Mr Le Vell praised Greater Manchester Police for a ""fair, thorough and independent investigation"", adding that he was ""delighted to be completely exonerated"" by the decision to take no further action.

A year later however, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions overturned the decision and brought a prosecution case against him.

'He's been exonerated'

Again, Mr Le Vell denied the accusations and said they were ""an absolute pack of lies"" which he would ""fight vigorously"".

During the trial, the prosecution put it to Mr Le Vell his witness box performance was just an act.

But a jury of eight women and four men did not believe he was acting and the actor left the court a free man.

His on-screen and off-screen friend Mr Pivaro sees no reason why Mr Le Vell cannot resume his Coronation Street career.

""I think the indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? He's been exonerated,"" said Mr Pivaro.

""We'll see, but let's face it, who amongst us can say that we are whiter than white, squeaky clean?

""Most of us have got skeletons in the cupboard of one kind or another but that doesn't make us criminals or sex offenders.""","['court', 'vell', 'trial', 'stars', 'demons', 'laid', 'le', 'onscreen', 'mr', 'street', 'kevin', 'bare', 'michael', 'webster']","Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week.

Barrymore praises 'support of public',,[],2003-01-30 11:55:17,"Television entertainer Michael Barrymore has said the support of the public had kept him from descending into a ""pit of depression"" after the death of a man found in a swimming pool at his home.

Speaking to the Herts and Essex Observer, Mr Barrymore, said: ""Those close to me love me, and despite what the press would have you believe, I get support from the public.

""That combined with the AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) has kept me well and from going into a pit of depression from which I might not get out.""

Stuart Lubbock, 31, a butchery supervisor from Harlow, Essex, was found floating in a swimming pool at Mr Barrymore's home in nearby Roydon in March 2001.

He was declared dead in hospital shortly afterwards.

Police said Mr Lubbock had been one of a number of people attending a party at Mr Barrymore's luxury home.

Mr Barrymore was cautioned by police for the possession and supply of a Class B drug, the possession of a class A drug and allowing his home to be used for the taking of a class B drug.

New investigation

Tests showed that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe internal injuries.

But at an inquest in September medical experts could not agree on the cause of death and a coroner recorded an open verdict.

Partygoers who gave evidence at the inquest could not explain Mr Lubbock's injuries.

Detectives recently started a new investigation after Mr Barrymore's lawyers asked them to look into the possibility that Mr Lubbock suffered the injuries at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow.","['possession', 'support', 'class', 'public', 'swimming', 'praises', 'mr', 'barrymore', 'barrymores', 'suffered', 'lubbock', 'essex']","Television entertainer Michael Barrymore has said the support of the public had kept him from descending into a ""pit of depression"" after the death of a man found in a swimming pool at his home.

Noranside prison to close for Christmas,,[],2009-12-06 14:10:52,"HMP Noranside currently houses about 100 prisoners An open jail is to close for Christmas while inmates go home on leave. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed Noranside prison, in Angus, will be mothballed for a week over the festive period. The prison currently has about 100 inmates. Any prisoners not eligible for Christmas leave will be moved to nearby Castle Huntly prison. The SPS said the prison had also closed last Christmas. It is not known how many prisoners will be given leave. The spokesman added: ""That is the plan at the moment - we did that last year. ""The numbers in the open estate are quite low, but if you have prisoners in the open estate and they have been risk assessed, it makes sense that gets tested.

Scottish Conservative MSP ""That is part of the parole process. If the prisoners misbehave or breach their conditions they are back in closed conditions."" The larger Castle Huntly, near Dundee, would be able to accommodate the reduced open population from Noranside over the festive period on its own. Serious offenders, including killers coming towards the end of their sentences, could be among those released. But Tory community safety spokesman John Lamont branded the plans ""quite incredible"". He said: ""Many victims of these criminals, and families of those killed, are still bearing emotional or physical scars and they will have to watch in horror as they are sent home to enjoy a week with their families."" Political rows A Scottish government spokeman said: ""Only prisoners that have undergone a stringent risk assessment, conducted by the Scottish Prison Service, will be considered for being tested in home conditions - one of the vital functions of the open estate - over the Christmas period. ""These prisoners have already been subject to rigorous assessment prior to their progression to open prison."" The open estate has been at the centre of political rows in recent years. Sex offender Robert Foye absconded from Castle Huntly in 2007 after being let out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and raped a 16-year-old girl before being recaptured. This led to a tightening of controls over who is sent to open jails. But this year murderer John Brown and armed robber Brian Martin - dubbed ""the Hawk"" - both absconded in quick succession from Castle Huntly.

Communications Bill: Data access 'vital' anti-gang tool,"Government plans to monitor all Britons' online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament is told.",[],None,"Image caption Ministers argue law enforcement agencies need to keep pace with changing technology

Government plans to monitor all Britons' online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament has been told.

Ministers want to strengthen the law on internet data retention to help the police tackle security threats.

Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said access to data could help ""capture people further up the tree"" in organised gangs.

Home Secretary Theresa May will face questions on the issue on Wednesday.

Under the government's plans, currently being scrutinised by Parliament, service providers will have to store details of internet use in the UK for a year to allow police and intelligence services to access it.

New platforms

Records will include people's activity on social network sites, webmail, internet phone calls and online gaming.

Civil liberties campaigners and MPs from all parties have expressed concerns about the scope of the new powers.

But giving evidence to the parliamentary committee studying the proposals, Mr Fahy said getting access to basic details of who was talking to whom were ""absolutely vital"" in ""proving associations"" between criminals.

Data Communications Bill The Bill extends the range of data telecoms firms will have to store for up to 12 months

It will include for the first time details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming in addition to emails and phone calls

The data includes the time, duration, originator and recipient of a communication and the location of the device from which it is made

It does not include the content of messages - what is being said. Officers will need a warrant to see that

But they will not need the permission of a judge to see details of the time and place of messages provided they are investigating a crime or protecting national security

Four bodies will have access to data: police, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, the intelligence agencies and HM Revenue and Customs

Local authorities will face restrictions on the kinds of data they can access

In his force's fight against organised crime in Manchester, Sir Peter said it was often able to penetrate the top of a criminal gang by linking ""foot soldiers"" selling drugs or stolen goods to those running operations.

But he said he was ""very fearful"" about the authorities' ability to keep track of suspects in future as they changed their behaviour and used social media and other less traceable channels to interact.

""What you are trying to prove is associations between different groups of criminals,"" he said.

""Up to now we have been able to use the more readily available communications data but criminals are realising that and moving to new technology and platforms.

""We already have specific examples of them using new platforms to defeat us.""

Asked to give details of the new methods that criminals were using, Sir Peter said he was reluctant to reveal too much since offenders could be listening to the hearing, but he identified online ""gaming platforms"" as a growing concern.

Although many internet service providers were ""very co-operative"" at the moment in responding to police requests for information, others were ""essentially obstructive"", he said, and this needed to change.

Privacy risk

Giving evidence earlier on Tuesday, a leading IT executive said there were ""big downsides"" to the government's proposals ""in terms of people having their privacy invaded"".

Trefor Davies, chief technology officer of business-focused service provider Timico Limited, said high-profile data losses by government departments and banks in recent years showed information held by the state and private firms could not be regarded as totally secure.

Citing the example of someone visiting the Alcoholics Anonymous website, he said sensitive information was at risk of being compromised if details of online behaviour were stored on a database and then a laptop containing information was left in the back of a cab. He said: ""This kind of information will escape.""

While the industry wanted to help the authorities to ""catch crooks"" and prevent mass terrorist attacks, he said there needed to be serious debate about the privacy implications of the proposals.

Privacy campaigner Guy Hosein, from Privacy International, said police and other public authorities already had access to the information, and there was no need for new legislation. ""This data is already collected here in this country,"" he said.","['access', 'internet', 'online', 'social', 'bill', 'need', 'authorities', 'data', 'help', 'details', 'information', 'tool', 'communications', 'vital', 'antigang']","Ministers want to strengthen the law on internet data retention to help the police tackle security threats.

Gazza's 'drug-fuelled paranoia',,[],2009-03-23 18:02:38,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Paul Gascoigne has described how his drug-induced paranoia led him to insanity during some of his darkest hours. During a BBC interview, the former England football star admitted locking the bible in a safe, fearing that it was ""listening"" to his conversations. The 41-year-old spent weeks on cocaine binges in hotels in Gateshead and was too scared to go outside. He said: ""My heart failed three times while I was taking drugs."" He added: ""This time, when I went into rehab, they asked me who I was, and I really didn't know. ""The Gazza side of me is still there; the fun and jokes, but now I want to become Paul Gascoigne and for people to know me as Paul Gascoigne - not too serious but serious enough about things that matter to me.

It was a shock to be sectioned, to be put in a mental home, but it was my family's choice because they could not do anything for me.



Paul Gascoigne

""I have worked on myself and I have got better, but it has taken a long time. ""At one point I got really paranoid. I was drinking a lot, not a bottle of whisky a day, but gin because I thought people could not smell it. ""I'm not the first person to say 'I will do this and I will do that', but this time my recovery will come first, before everything else. ""In the past every time I left rehab I thought 'I'm going to have a drink' and I had no thought of that this time."" Gascoigne became a millionaire overnight when he was transferred from Newcastle to Spurs in 1988, and later secured a £1.25m deal with Italian club Lazio. He retired in 2004 and his addiction to drugs and alcohol spiralled out of control. Now he is working on a 12-steps rehabilitation programme and going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He added: ""It was a shock to be sectioned, to be put in a mental home, but it was my family's choice because they could not do anything for me.

Ex-burglar says 'some people need to be in prison',A prolific burglar with more than 100 convictions says a second chance helped him turn his life around but some people need to be in jail.,[],None,"Image caption Ex-offender Jodie Hind has been in and out of prison since the age of 14

Ex-burglar and drug pusher Jodie Hind has a string of convictions longer than his arm - more than 100. So many in fact, he cannot remember the exact number.

He was first jailed for theft on his 14th birthday and for the next 16 years was in and out of prison dozens of times for a ""mind-blowing"" number of offences.

At his lowest ebb he was breaking into houses to steal money to feed a heroin and crack cocaine habit.

And when things were going ""well"", in his eyes, he was making £1,000 a day selling drugs and spending it on sports cars, jewellery and clothes.

But every few months he would find himself back inside. According to the 34-year-old, most people had written him off and did not believe he could break the cycle of crime.

But break it he did, with a lot of professional help, and today he is drug-free and has not committed a crime for more than four years.

'Big baby'

Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems Jodie Hind

On Wednesday Judge Peter Bowers caused controversy when he said burglars were ""courageous"" and decided to give serial burglar Richard Rochford a supervision order instead of jail.

The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"".

Mr Hind agrees that jail does not always work, but many offenders still need to be locked up.

He said: ""Some people need to be in prison for the safety of the public. Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems.

Image caption Jessie Jacobs said ""the whole area of justice"" needs reform

""I was not facing up to the fact I had character defects and these were were manifesting themselves in addictions such as drug-taking and alcohol.

""I had problems such as managing anger, I was like a big baby, and replacing one addiction with another.

""But I have a conscience and I feel most shame about dealing in drugs. I am also haunted about burgling people's homes.

""I thought I could cheat my way through life but with lots of help I have turned my life around and changed my way of thinking.""

'Without hope'

Through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction agencies, Mr Hind now works for Five Lamps, a Stockton charity which helps the unemployed get jobs or start their own business.

Mr Hind said his father was an alcoholic but on the whole he and his sister had a good upbringing. But he kept lapsing into crime because he was ""immature and without hope"".

The judge could have chosen his words more carefully - burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate Jessie Jacobs, Chief Executive of charity A Way Out

He said: ""My recovery was very public. I've decided to stay in the area where I committed my crimes and a lot of people don't approve of me.

""But I believe in reform, I am accountable for my actions. I am up for what the judge has said, some people should be in prison but the prison numbers are too big.

""I believe with the right help people can be reformed.""

Mr Hind is not afraid of having a relapse. He said: ""Everyday I take stock. I have changed my way of thinking.

""I am responsible for my actions and learn from other people who have overcome their problems.""

Jessie Jacobs is the chief executive of A Way Out, a charity which helps women and young people to tackle a range of problems including depression, addiction, self harm and exploitation.

It has been running for 10 years and helps about 1,000 people a year.

Ms Jacobs said: ""The judge could have chosen his words more carefully. Burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate. So while I do not condone the judge's choice of words I welcome the fact that he has opened up a debate.

The Moth flies in to tell stories,,['Steven Brocklehurst'],2009-08-23 11:26:58,"The Moth flies in to tell stories

By Steven Brocklehurst

BBC Scotland news

George Dawes Green's idea has developed into salons around the world A cult storytelling salon, which has become a literary phenomenon around the world, is to have its European premiere at the Edinburgh Book Festival. The Moth was founded in New York in 1997 by novelist George Dawes Green. Speakers are given 10 minutes to tell a story without the aid of notes or memorising their material. The sell-out Edinburgh event included raconteur and playwright Edgar Oliver and Jessie Klein on her erotic adventures in Disney World. Holes in the screen Mr Green said the idea for The Moth began in his home state of Georgia in the USA. He drank Bourbon with friends and told stories until the moths began to fly through the holes in the screen on the porch door. Later, in New York, Mr Green wanted to set up a similar arrangement. ""There are lots of raconteurs in New York,"" he said. ""But nobody has any time. ""So I invited them to my apartment and we started to tell stories and it became The Moth."" Now there are hundreds of Moths all over the world. Events have recently been held in Australia and Tajikistan. The Moth's podcasts are the second biggest in the world, with hundreds of thousands of downloads each week. People have been telling what I call kitchen stories but they have never been made public until The Moth began

George Dawes Green Mr Green said the best stories were personal and true - although a bit of embellishment was never a problem. He said: ""The great raconteurs have a real sense of rhythm and understanding of how to use their voice. ""There also has to be a real vulnerability, the best stories are usually about failure."" He said celebrities sometimes tried to impress with tales of success - but usually fell flat. ""And there should be no fancy language, speak in the vernacular,"" he added. Another mistake is to think a story had to have a moral, Mr Green said. ""When we first began, people were pouring out their soul like Alcoholics Anonymous,"" he said. ""People want to hear the essence of a story."" Mr Green, who is also promoting his new novel Ravens, said the ""public raconteur"" was a new phenomenon. He said: ""When Homer told stories, they were memorised poems. Folk tales were memorised. People have been telling what I call kitchen stories but they have never been made public until The Moth began. ""It is a new thing but it has started to sweep the world.""

Drunken father 'forgets' his baby,,[],2008-05-13 15:03:46,"A drunken father who abandoned his six-month old daughter in a sweet shop has been put on probation.

Shaun Marshall was three times over the legal limit to drive when he ""forgot"" his baby, leaving her in her buggy.

The 27-year-old of Westerhope, Newcastle, who had drunk ""a skinful"" the previous day and night, drove off with his two other children.

He admitted being drunk in charge of children on 17 February and was put on probation for nine months.

Marshall, of Rogerson Terrace, also admitted drink-driving at Newcastle Magistrates' Court and was banned from driving for two years.

Prosecuting, Mark Brennan said that about 1730 BST staff at the Candy Man sweet shop on Victoria Crescent, Cullercoats, called the police to report that a man had abandoned a baby.

CCTV footage showed Marshall leaving the shop with his two toddlers but leaving the baby by the door.

He then drove off in his Mercedes Benz.

When he returned 10 minutes later, police were waiting and he was breathalysed and arrested.

'Close to death

A blood alcohol test showed he had 240mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, when the legal limit is 80mg.

Mr Brennan said: ""He told police he was tired and confused. He accepts he was over the limit and accepts the stupidity of driving the vehicle with his young children in the car.""

Defending, John Monkhouse said Marshall had stopped drinking and was attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He said: ""Sometimes it takes a tragedy before a situation will strike home to somebody.

""Fortunately this time a tragedy was averted and nothing too serious happened. He had drunk a skinful the previous day.""

Chairman of the bench George Mitchell said: ""If you were three times over the limit when you gave that blood sample then at some stage during the night you must have been close to death.

""To be four times over the limit is to be heading towards the breakdown of your bodily functions.""

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.","['Nicola Beckford', 'Bbc Radio', 'The World At One']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done""

As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders.

A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before.

There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences.

The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.

Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"".

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before.

Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired.

But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent.

However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence.

Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754.

Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.

'Bitter experience'

Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"".

He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem.

""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent.""

In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London.

Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years.

The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving.

Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together.""

He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions.

""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London.

""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. ""

'Get carried away'

Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks.

He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again.

He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving.

""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving.""

Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests.

""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.

""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it.""

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road.

""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

Lives 'destroyed' by alcohol,,[],2002-11-12 15:31:47,"Here, two recovering alcoholics tell their story to BBC News Online Scotland.

Charlie, 50, has been sober for 10 years. He grew up in Shettleston, in Glasgow's east end and now lives in Ayrshire.

In his own words, Charlie tells how his life was destroyed by his addiction.

I was 15-years-old. I was leaving home with my father chasing me along the road waving an axe at my head.

The madness that is alcoholism had erupted in our house again.

Shouting, screaming, hurt, anger, drunken rages and conflicts that were never settled, that was the home I was raised in.



As a teenager I was known as Shettleston's orphan



My own drinking took me to the streets. As a teenager I was known by many as 'Shettleston's orphan'.

I was to enter the doors of many prisons and institutions as my life degenerated.

An attempt at marriage when I was in my late teens failed miserably.

I know now that I didn't have the skills to build and maintain a relationship. Thankfully, I have them now.

I eventually managed to keep away from alcohol for years and got myself a good life and an education.



Not drinking is not a problem, drinking certainly was



Sadly, I drank again and alcohol removed everything I had gained, my wife and family, my career, and any vestige of sanity.

I went to Alcoholics Anonymous and found help.

I began to realise that I was a very ill person.

Things are different today, I'm a few years away from alcohol and I have my life back.

Not drinking is not a problem, drinking certainly was.

Carol, 32, lives in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, and has been sober for seven years.

My name is Carol and I am an alcoholic.

I have not had a drink for seven years since coming to Alcoholics Anonymous, finding out what I suffer from and applying the solution to my illness.

I drank from the age of 14, being a very fearful and insecure child.

When I took drink it made me into the person I had always wanted to be, confident, communicative and the life and soul of the party.



I destroyed a husband and three beautiful children through my addiction



Coming back to Alcoholics Anonymous 22-years-later it had taken everything - friends, family, my dignity and self-respect and almost my life.

My alcoholism affected everyone I came into contact with which included employers, friends, partners etc.

But most importantly the people who I affected most were my loved ones - my mother and father.

Then when I married I destroyed a husband and three beautiful children through my addiction.

Alcohol comes in bottles, alcoholism comes in people.

I thank God I have had the chance to treat my illness one day at a time and make amends to the people I have damaged - which I call 'the slaughter of innocents'.","['took', 'sober', 'teenager', 'life', 'alcoholism', 'alcohol', 'anonymous', 'alcoholics', 'drinking', 'destroyed', 'lives']","In his own words, Charlie tells how his life was destroyed by his addiction.

Lohan's spokeswoman would not say where the centre was located or what the actress was being treated for.

Telling off

Lohan's frequent partying and drunken exits from nightclubs were a fixture of tabloid newspapers last year.

In July, Morgan Creek Productions chief executive James G Robinson sent a letter to the actress rebuking her for arriving late on set for the film Georgia Rule, suggesting ""heavy partying"" was to blame.

""You have acted like a spoiled child, alienated many of your co-workers and endangered the quality of this picture,"" he was quoted as saying in the letter.

The actress admitted that she became worried by her portrayal in the press.

""I was like, 'I don't want to be written about at these clubs with these people',"" she told People magazine last year.

Priest's sex 'shame' with student,,[],2007-04-03 20:07:42,"Father Gerry Nugent also admitted in court to being an alcoholic

Father Gerry Nugent, 63, said he had a sexual relationship with Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in August or September 2005.

The 23-year-old's body was found under the floor of St Patrick's Church in Anderston, in September 2006.

Peter Tobin, 60, denies murdering Miss Kluk and hiding her body. The trial at the High Court in Edinburgh continues.

Father Nugent admitted he had abused the position of trust he was in.

He said sexual intimacy between the two happened ""about three or four times"" but he denied being in love with Ms Kluk.

Alcoholics Anonymous

Questioned by Dorothy Bain QC, prosecuting, he said: ""I felt shame. I was disgusted at myself. I knew I was wrong and I wanted to make it right.

""I knew I was doing wrong and I was guilty.

""I felt terrible and I knew it had to stop so that part of the relationship stopped.""

He added ""I felt peace within myself when it was over. I still had the same feelings for her in terms of admiration and in my opinion the relationship was better because I was aware nothing was going wrong.""

Angelika's body was found under the floor of the church

The court heard he went on to visit Miss Kluk in Poland in February 2006.

Father Nugent also admitted to being an alcoholic.

He said he went to Alcoholics Anonymous 10 years ago and discovered then that he had the illness.

The priest said he last saw Ms Kluk on Sunday 24 September, last year, in the garage of the chapel house with Mr Tobin, who was working as a handyman at the church.

Mr Tobin - known to Father Nugent as Pat McLaughlin - was building a shed and Ms Kluk was helping paint it.

Ms Bain read Father Nugent part of a statement he had given to the police in which he said: ""At about 2.30 that afternoon I popped into the garage and saw Pat and Angela.

""Pat said to me he was getting great help from his apprentice.""

The priest also described the night Angelika's lover Martin MacAskill and her sister Aneta called in police after the student's disappearance.

I was not dealing with the situation very well

Father Gerry Nugent

He said he went to his room in the chapel house to pray.

""I was not dealing with the situation very well,"" he said.

""I was just round the bend with the whole thing.""

Father Nugent recounted Mr Tobin's conversation with the first police officers on the scene.

Mr Tobin had said someone had come to collect Angelika and that she had gone to play golf.

""He said she was going out and whoever she was going out with had a nice car,"" the priest said.

Father Nugent also told the court that he never got to bed that night and that it was the last time he saw Mr Tobin.

'Getting worried'

""After the mass the next morning, several times that morning, I phoned Pat's number because I was getting worried about him,"" he said.

""I wondered if it had been getting too much the night before.

""He never came back at all.""

The charge against Mr Tobin alleges that between 24 and 29 September he raped and murdered Ms Kluk then hid the body under the floor of the church.

He denies all charges against him.

In a special defence Mr Tobin has admitted having sex with the Polish student, with her consent.

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",[],None,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime

The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.

The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one.

One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"".

In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government's drug strategy but these were not pursued.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.

The government also says 80% of the UK's 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits.

'Road to recovery'

In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"".

""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.

""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.""

There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope

Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.

""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added.

""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.""

The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.

But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need.

""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.""

'No evidence'

Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government's flagship welfare-to-work programme.

One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.

""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes

""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.""

It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.

""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added.

""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities.

Brothers jailed for East Kilbride text mistake killing,Two brothers who killed a local football referee at his home in Lanarkshire are each jailed for 10 years.,[],None,"Image caption Christopher and Robert Abraham admitted killing David Linning

Two brothers have each been jailed for 10 years for killing a man they thought had assaulted their mother.

Christopher and Robert Abraham, aged 26 and 20, attacked local football referee David Linning, 65, at his home in East Kilbride in Lanarkshire last December.

The assault happened after they received a text from their mother, who was in a relationship with Mr Linning, saying she had a ""sore face"".

The brothers later learned she had tripped and fallen while drunk.

Mr Linning was punched, kicked and slashed on the face with a knife during the attack.

His body was not found until two days later when a friend came to collect him to referee a football match in the town.

The brothers, who are the sons of former Radio Clyde presenter Mr Abie, were sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.

He was so helpful he was trying to help the two guys who killed him to get off the drink Billy Linning, Victim's son

They had earlier admitted a charge of culpable homicide.

Judge Lady Stacey told them: ""What you did that day was wicked.

""You went to the home of a man in his 60s when you were both fuelled by drink and, as you well know, drink is no excuse.

""You then proceeded to attack him. Two young men attacking an older man.""

Lady Stacey noted that both Abraham brothers had expressed remorse but added: ""No remorse you can now express can do anything to take away the anguish that Mr Linning's family - his large family - must feel because of what you did.""

Speaking after the sentencing Mr Linning's son Billy, 37, said the family was relieved the case was over.

Well-known figure

He added: ""We would just like to say we are very happy with the outcome.

""It has been absolutely horrific. No two days are the same for any of us. Everyone is totally devastated and will be for many many years to come.""

His son also told how Mr Linning, a dedicated volunteer with Alcoholics Anonymous, had been trying to help his killers overcome their problems with alcohol.

He said: ""He was so helpful he was trying to help the two guys who killed him to get off the drink.""

Mr Linning was a well-known figure around East Kilbride as a result of 30 years refereeing amateur football and hundreds of mourners attended his funeral.

In court defence lawyers described how the Abraham family had been blighted by alcohol and how at the time of the killing the brothers were homeless due to their drinking.

Defence QC Ian Duguid said if those involved had been sober, proper explanations could have been provided.

Lady Stacey said the brothers, who have a string of minor convictions, had been judged to be a high risk and made an order extending their licence conditions, after release, by two years.","['kilbride', 'mistake', 'abraham', 'linning', 'stacey', 'help', 'mr', 'text', 'jailed', 'east', 'brothers', 'trying', 'killing', 'family']","Image caption Christopher and Robert Abraham admitted killing David LinningTwo brothers have each been jailed for 10 years for killing a man they thought had assaulted their mother.

Shot Chelsea lawyer Mark Saunders 'asked for his wife',The widow of a barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off tells an inquest she could have defused the situation.,[],None,"Image caption Mr Saunders' family say he posed no real risk to the public

The widow of an alcoholic barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off told an inquest she could have defused the situation.

Mark Saunders, 32, was hit in the head and chest by five police bullets at his Chelsea home in May 2008.

Elizabeth Saunders told Westminster Coroner's Court: ""I know that Mark would never, ever have hurt me.""

Mr Saunders asked negotiators if he could speak to his wife, but she said police told her to turn her phone off.

Mrs Saunders, also a barrister at QEB chambers, said that her husband told their senior clerk he had been ""firing his gun and that the police were coming and he was in trouble"" in a phone call shortly before 1700 BST.

Blank text

She made her way home but was stopped at the police cordon. Officers then asked her to switch off her mobile phone.

She said she heard a ""lot of commotion"" but did not know her husband was dead until 2230 BST.

Later when she switched on her phone, she found a blank text from him.

Image caption Mark Saunders' family say he posed no risk to the public

Mrs Saunders said: ""That would have been the only time in our relationship that he sent me a text message and he did not get an immediate call from me saying, 'Darling, I am here'.

""That is very difficult for me, but there it is. I did not know he had called.""

She told the inquest: ""The truth of our relationship was Mark and I loved each other.

""I think he would have just said 'Darling, I am sorry'. And I would have said 'Sweetheart, it is OK. Do not worry, we will sort this out'.""

The inquest also heard that Mr Saunders had texted Alex Booth, the best man at his wedding, during the stand-off.

The message said: ""This is the end, my only friend, the end.""

Mr Booth told the court they would often quote films and music to each other, and the message appeared to be quoting from a song by The Doors used in the film Apocalypse Now.

The hearing was told Mr Saunders had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from his GP to control his drinking.

The family law expert had been prescribed anti-depressants and had also taken cocaine in the months leading up to his death.

'Love for life'

Mrs Saunders said she thought he had been drinking heavily on the day of his killing.

She said her husband was a ""very sensitive and caring man"" with ""huge energy and love for life"".

Mrs Saunders said he had been teetotal apart from a few ""blips"".

She said: ""There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

On the day of his death Mr Saunders had been out on various errands and seemed ""very happy"".

Cab driver David Hay, who dropped him later in the day, told the inquest: ""He looked straight at me, and just said, 'I'm going to die'.""

The death of Mr Saunders, who was once in the Territorial Army, was filmed from a police helicopter.

Police had been called after neighbours saw him firing a shotgun into a neighbouring flat.

The officers say they were firing in self-defence, or to protect others.

None of them is to be prosecuted, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

Mr Saunders' family maintain he presented no risk to the public.

She admitted reckless assault in a plea bargain with prosecutors at Manhattan Criminal Court last month.

As well as community service, the 36-year-old was also ordered to attend an anger management course.

Fourth complaint

Campbell has apologised for assaulting her maid - the fourth such complaint against her - and agreed to take the course.

Dorset woman's bulimia made her suicidal,"With National Eating Disorders Awareness Week well under way, a Weymouth woman reveals how she freed herself from the vicious cycle of bulimia and overeating.","['Thelma', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows.

Three years ago Anne-Marie wanted to die.

For 11 years the Weymouth office worker, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity, had been trapped in a vicious cycle of surreptitious binge-eating and vomiting.

By 2008 her eating disorder had taken over her life to the extent that once her bills were paid any remaining money was spent on food.

""My life revolved around food,"" the 27-year-old told BBC News. ""On a typical morning I would go to the supermarket to fill two shopping bags with bread, chocolate, cakes and biscuits.

""Then I'd go home, eat it and stick my two fingers down my throat to make myself sick.""

Anne-Marie is among some 1.6 million people in the UK with an eating disorder, according to Beat, a charity which supports adults and young people affected by this form of mental illness.

It has been running a host of events across the country to mark Eating Disorder Awareness Week.

A spokeswoman for the charity said: ""We believe more people are becoming aware that it is a serious psychological condition.

""There are so many preconceptions but you can beat an eating disorder.""

In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child Anne-Marie

Sufferers exhibit an abnormal attitude towards food which causes them to drastically alter their eating habits and behaviour.

Another type of eating disorder is anorexia nervosa, where a person starves themselves and exercises excessively to maintain a life-threateningly low weight.

Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, with 90% of people with the condition female, according to the NHS Choices website.

For Anne-Marie's behaviour to go undetected at work, she had to employ cunning tactics - locking herself in her office at lunchtime to binge-eat and then vomiting in the nearby ladies' toilet.

She said she always feared a passing colleague would hear her.

""I was frightened people would see what I was eating and the amounts,"" Anne-Marie explained.

""I did all my eating in secret and then ate normally in front of people.""

Anne-Marie blames an inability to express her emotions as a child and being unhappy with her appearance for her self-destructive behaviour.

""I did not like the way I looked,"" she added. ""In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child.

""I tried to control these feelings through food.""

'First bite'

She said she had fallen ""into the depths of despair"" when fate intervened in the form of her future husband Jonathan whom she met through mutual friends at a party.

""He had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for seven years and suggested I attend an Overeaters Anonymous (OA) meeting.

""I was sceptical about it, at first, but then I found I liked the people there.""

Anne-Marie credits the meetings - which she has been attending up to three times a week for the past three years - with bringing about an end to her binge-eating and purging cycle.

""I have learned to express myself and am now aware that if I am compelled to overeat there are unresolved emotions,"" she continued.

""We also encourage each other at the meetings to call someone before we take the first bite.""

Other OA tools Anne-Marie now uses as a part of her coping mechanism include writing her thoughts down and offering support to fellow attendees.

She added: ""My life is really good now, I am happily married, I changed my job and I express my feelings more.

""The fact that I have not binged or vomited to get through my day a miracle and a relief.""","['suicidal', 'disorder', 'express', 'reality', 'life', 'womans', 'times', 'annemarie', 'eating', 'anorexia', 'nervosa', 'dorset', 'ugly', 'bulimia']","Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows.

Brixton drug centre gets go ahead,,[],2005-12-14 16:13:48,"Residents opposed the drug centre

The South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's centre got planning permission from Lambeth Council on Tuesday.

People living in Brighton Terrace, south London, fear it will worsen the current problem of crack and heroin addicts taking drugs in their street.

The trust said it would work with local people and police to ensure the centre was safe and well run.

The move comes in the week the Metropolitan Police (Met) started clamping down on people caught carrying cannabis in the centre of Brixton.

It is hoped this will discourage drug tourists and aggressive dealers who hide behind the more relaxed laws associated with the Class C drug.

The tough stance contrasts to the ""softly softly"" approach to cannabis which was piloted in Brixton before the drug was downgraded to Class C.

Paul Gill, of the Brighton Terrace Residents Association, said: ""Putting a drugs rehabilitation centre in Brixton is like telling an alcoholic they just have to walk through a brewery to get to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""This is a residential street and we have real problems with addicts in our street and this will just increase the influx of them.""

But a spokesman for the trust said: ""There is a major drugs problem in Lambeth and we know that we can provide an important part of the solution to that by bringing people into treatment.

""Research shows that treatment reduces drug-related crime - so this is good news for everyone in Lambeth, as well as for people who are working to overcome addictions.""","['gets', 'telling', 'centre', 'lambeth', 'ahead', 'trust', 'drug', 'terrace', 'residents', 'walk', 'brixton', 'drugs']","Residents opposed the drug centreThe South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's centre got planning permission from Lambeth Council on Tuesday.

""It's not a matter of just apologising for some words you've said,"" Reiner, 60, told Associated Press Radio.

""It's to really understand why it is you're anti-Semitic and where those feelings came from.""

Gibson apologised for making ""harmful"" anti-Semitic comments following his arrest for drink-driving in July.

The actor was arrested on 28 July after being seen driving at 87mph (139km/h) on a 45mph (72km/h) stretch of Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway, the local sheriff's department said.

Gibson called the remarks made during his arrest ""despicable""

Gibson, 50, admitted he had suffered a relapse in his battle with alcoholism.

""Please know from my heart I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith,"" said the film-maker, in a statement released earlier this month.

He was ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous afer pleading no contest to a drink-driving charge earlier this month.

Director Reiner, who is Jewish, is best known for films including Stand By Me, A Few Good Men and When Harry Met Sally.

'Long process'

He made particular reference to Gibson's biblical epic The Passion of the Christ, recently named the most controversial movie to date by US magazine Entertainment Weekly.

The film, which focused on the final 12 hours in Jesus's life, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism on its release two years ago.

""When he can come out and say, you know, 'My views have been reflected in my work and I feel bad that I've done that,' then that will be the beginning of some reconciliation for him,"" Reiner told AP.

""I believe that people can be redeemed and people can change, but that's going to be a very long process,"" he said","['films', 'attacks', 'reiner', 'gibsons', 'youve', 'rob', 'earlier', 'antisemitic', 'know', 'arrest', 'youre', 'drinkdriving', 'work', 'told']","Reiner directed and starred in This Is Spinal Tap""It's not a matter of just apologising for some words you've said,"" Reiner, 60, told Associated Press Radio.

He was sacked as consultant vascular surgeon, but escaped being struck off the medical register.

The General Medical Council suspended him for nine months last August.

Lattimer, of Wallington, Surrey, lost his job after he was tracked down in Operation Ore, an international investigation into paedophiles.

In January last year, he admitted 10 charges of making indecent photographs of children and was given a 36-month rehabilitation order.

He returned before the GMC on Friday, and was given permission to return to work, but was told he would have to remain on the sex offenders' register.

Committee chairman John Shaw said it would be disproportionate to extend the suspension in spite of the seriousness of the matter.

He said the panel noted the surgeon's ""considerable efforts"" to keep up to date and his attendance at lectures and conferences.

Lattimer will be randomly tested for alcohol and barred from treating children under the age of 16 for two years.

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",[],None,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority

Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBC's Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject.

Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city.

Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink.

This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet.

The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims.

Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export.

'Increasing trend'

Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation

The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistan's status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink.

The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced.

Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle.

Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years.

Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says.

I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore

Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics.

He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings.

And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment.

""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""It's much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied.""

Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself.

He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britain's Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body.

'Taboo for women'

Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera.

But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor.

Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater.

In Pakistan's second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story.

Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts.

""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me.""

Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking

As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan.

""Some men will turn around and say, 'Okay, I have a problem.' But it's a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. That's not acceptable.""

Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering.

In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment.

Clients are admitted with their families' consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications.

One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian.

But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him.

""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now.""

'I'm listening'

Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu

While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too.

On Karachi's Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one.

""Go ahead. I'm listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio.

There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu.

Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous.

The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent.

Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject.

""I'm not concerned about the name,"" he said.

""If they're talking about a problem, it's not just them who's benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed.""

There is no chance of Pakistan's legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing.

At least more alcoholics are now coming forward to talk about it - and some are finding a way out of their misery.","['social', 'addiction', 'battles', 'problem', 'say', 'caption', 'woman', 'alcohol', 'radio', 'therapy', 'supposed', 'drinking', 'growing', 'pakistan']","Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majorityAlcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink.

Prisoner rape case review ordered,,[],2008-01-24 16:10:29,"Foye was on the run for several days before the attack

Robert Foye, 28, admitted raping the 16-year-old girl in Cumbernauld in August last year after absconding from Castle Huntly, near Dundee.

Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has asked for an internal review of the jail by the Scottish Prison Service.

The announcement came after opposition parties raised concern over the case at question time in the parliament.

Foye, who has yet to be sentenced after admitting the assault at the High Court in Glasgow, was allowed out of Castle Huntly to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, but did not return.

'Horror' case

He had been on the run for almost a week when he carried out the attack.

Foye had been half way through a 10-year sentence for attempting to murder a policeman.

First Minister Alex Salmond pledged to tackle ""deficiencies"" in the system, telling MSPs that the problems would be addressed through the government's prisons commission.

But Annabel Goldie, the Conservative leader, demanded a review at Castle Huntly.

""The immediate horror presented by this appalling case is sadly just the latest incident in a spiralling pattern of prison escapes,"" she said, adding that official figures showed nearly half of those who walked out of open prisons had a violent background.

Labour leader Wendy Alexander said of Foye: ""I was told this was only his second ever visit out of prison. A man like this should not have been allowed out on his own.""

She asked: ""What reassurance will the first minister offer that this will not happen again?""

An internal review has been ordered at Castle Huntly

Responding to the concerns, Mr Salmond told MSPs: ""I clearly think there are deficiencies within the system that this case illustrates and these deficiencies should be addressed.""

He said the case was a shocking one, adding: ""We should start by praising the courage of the victim of the attack, who helped to secure the apprehension and conviction of Robert Foye.""

Figures showed that 75 people absconded in 2006-07 - a small number, the first minister said, but still ""75 too many"".

""It is, however, an ever-present risk within an open prison system,"" he added.

Former first minister Henry McLeish, who chairs the prisons commission, has also been asked to include the role of open prisons in his review.","['foye', 'system', 'deficiencies', 'case', 'open', 'rape', 'prisoner', 'castle', 'ordered', 'prisons', 'review', 'prison', 'minister']","Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has asked for an internal review of the jail by the Scottish Prison Service.

Overeaters Anonymous provides local help,,[],2010-12-30 14:02:00,"Statistics show the UK has the highest rate of eating disorders in Europe A Hertfordshire woman has spoken about an organisation which helps confront issues surrounding eating. For some, January is a time to resolve to lose weight, but for others, their problems are not solved by diet alone. Statistics show the UK has the highest rate of eating disorders in Europe, with 1.6 million people diagnosed. Support and guidance for those who have developed a negative relationship with food is available from Overeaters Anonymous (OA). OA started in the United States 50 years ago but now has meetings all over the world, including Beds, Herts and Bucks. Relationship Sarah is a member in Hertfordshire and told us that it's not just weight that brings people to meetings. ""We now have members who are underweight, overweight or anything in between"" she said, ""it's really much more about our relationship with food and what that does to us than it is about the weight. ""It is different for every person, it's not necessarily about the quantity of food or the type of food, or even perhaps the frequency [that you eat it] but it's about what it does to us. ""If you maybe over ate a little bit on Christmas day like a lot of people do, you might have felt a little bit uncomfortable that day, you might have eaten a little bit less the next day, or you might have gone out for a walk or something. But you're probably not still feeling bad about it now. For somebody who is an overeater or a compulsive eater, they feel terrible about it most days."" Sarah admitted that she used to obsess about food most of the time and would keep food in her bedside cabinet so that she could grab a bar of chocolate in the middle of the night. She said that it was the fact that it was making her unhappy that made her do something about it. ""It wasn't just my weight that was making me miserable"" she revealed, ""it was the fact that my life was being ruled by food. I constantly had to think about it and that's quite exhausting really. It's like any addiction, it takes up a lot of time and it makes us feel a bit rubbish."" Strength Based around the 'Twelve Steps' pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous, OA uses the same principles to give individuals the strength and hope they need to get on - and stay on - the road to recovery. The organisation offers practical support and methods to help members find relief from compulsive eating and obsessive thoughts about their body shape and size and deal with their negative relationship with food. It wasn't just my weight that was making me miserable, it was the fact that my life was being ruled by food.

Sarah Sarah has certain foods from which she now abstains but explained that you don't have to go down this particular route. ""I haven't eaten those foods for probably just over ten years now"" she said. ""For me, these are mainly sweet foods but it's different for different people. I wouldn't want people to think that if they come to OA they have to give up a certain foods. It's very much about each individual deciding for themselves what they need to do."" Like gyms and weight loss programmes, OA receive a higher number of enquiries and new members at the start of the year than other months and their groups provide a place where sufferers can meet people who have been through a similar experience. ""In January people are tending to think about making changes in their life and we can certainly offer help with that"" said Sarah. ""There are no professionals [at the meetings]"" she added, ""there are only people who are overeaters or compulsive eaters themselves, so all of those people have been to a first meeting at some stage. ""Whilst they don't know exactly what that individual is going through, they do remember what it was like. I'm very conscious of that when I talk to new people that I know how painful it was and how miserable I was, so people are understanding when somebody comes to a meeting for the first time.""

World Tonight: News of the World: no reason to celebrate?,The World Tonight blog,[],None,"So will you be buying a last copy of the News of the World on Sunday? A souvenir, to show to your grand-children: ""This is what we used to call a newspaper""?

Maybe not. Maybe you've never bought a copy in your life, and have no intention of starting now. Maybe you're delighted that a tabloid rag (your words, not mine) has finally been forced out of business.

Well, I hope you'll forgive me, but I'm a journalist, and I can never celebrate the death of a newspaper. Yes, of course, the News of the World is guilty of some appalling errors - it has behaved shockingly and it has paid the price.

But, as we pointed out on last night's programme, its record is not all bad. Some of its investigations really were in the public interest, and not just of interest to the public. (A fine distinction, I know, but a crucial one when we start discussing what is and is not a legitimate investigation.)

I'm a former Fleet Street news editor. (Or perhaps, in the style of Alcoholics Anonymous, I should say: ""My name is Robin and I am a recovering Fleet Street news editor."")

I never worked for a mass circulation Sunday paper (the one I worked for sold a tiny fraction of the copies the News of the World sells every week) - but I do know a little bit about the pressure to get stories.

So over the past few days, several people have asked me why on earth journalists would even think about trying to hack into the voicemail messages of bereaved military families or missing schoolgirls.

It's quite a simple question to answer. What matters more than anything to reporters is that they get good stories printed in the paper - preferably at the top of the page, even better on the front page.

That makes their editors happy, because it makes the proprietor happy, because it means the paper will sell more copies. As the former information commissioner Richard Thomas put it in his prescient report ""What price privacy?"", published more than five years ago: ""Journalists have a voracious demand for personal information, especially at the popular end of the market. The more information they reveal about celebrities or anyone remotely in the public eye, the more newspapers they can sell.""

Do newspaper readers want to read about tragedy and heartbreak? Do they lap up heartrending tales of grief and suffering? You know the answer as well as I do.

(And if you don't believe me, just look at the numbers. Biggest selling newspaper in the UK? News of the World.)

I sometimes liken journalists to undertakers. They both perform an essential task, but the detail of how they do it does not always make pleasant reading. If journalists break the law (and hacking into people's voicemail messages is illegal, just as paying a police officer to disclose information is), then they face prosecution. And a jury will decide whether what they did was in the public interest.

There will now be enormous pressure on the press to clean up their act and strengthen the monitoring of their behaviour. It would not in the least surprise me if the Press Complaints Commission, which two years ago concluded that there was nothing much to worry about in the phone-hacking allegations (""the Commission could not help but conclude that the Guardian's stories did not quite live up to the dramatic billing they were initially given"") is now quietly put out of its misery.

In a statement on Wednesday, it admitted that ""it can no longer stand by its 2009 report on phone hacking and the assertions made in it."" But if it is replaced, you'd better be prepared for many months of anguished debate about the correct balance to be struck between press freedom and the right to privacy.

Ed Miliband called in a speech this morning for the Commission to be replaced by something with much sharper teeth. Trouble is it's a very slippery slope from a system of regulation that includes the power to impose sanctions to a system of government licensing of newspapers.

As the former chairman of the PCC, Sir Christpher Meyer, commented: ""If Ed Miliband wants a press watchdog to be able to take evidence on oath, and have police powers of investigation, that's state not self-regulation.""

If it comes to a choice between entrusting our freedoms to government or to newspapers, I am sometimes reminded of Thomas Jefferson: ""If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.""

Let the debate begin.","['newspaper', 'newspapers', 'journalists', 'paper', 'public', 'tonight', 'reason', 'information', 'know', 'celebrate', 'commission', 'press', 'world']","So will you be buying a last copy of the News of the World on Sunday?

Pub machete attack man is jailed,,[],2004-06-23 15:15:32,"Frightened customers hid in the cellar at The Castle pub in Norwich

Russell Wooldridge, 38, of Bond Street, Norwich, admitted affray and causing £2,000 damage with a machete at the city's Castle pub in April 2003.

At Norwich Crown Court on Wednesday, Wooldridge, who has 16 previous convictions, also admitted wounding Edward Hicks in a separate incident.

He was jailed for a total of three years and 11 months.

Charles Myatt, prosecuting, said Wooldridge had been making disparaging comments about a customer and the pub, which is frequented by the gay and lesbian community.

Smashing doors

He threatened to kill a barman who asked him to move on as he was hassling customers.

Ten minutes later, after a pub window was smashed, the barman locked the doors and urged customers to retreat to the cellar as Wooldridge began smashing the doors with the machete and threatening to kill them and torch the pub.

Jailing him Judge Paul Downes said: ""You went on a one-man crusade and caused as much damage as you could and the customers went off to the cellar for safety.""

Mr Myatt said Wooldridge also attacked Mr Hicks after he struck up a relationship with one of his ex-girlfriends.

Ian James, defending, said Wooldridge was much-changed from the drunken man who carried out the pub attack.

""He says that drink has cost him everything.

Vigilante attack policeman jailed,,[],2008-09-25 14:44:23,"Lavelle admitted assault and perverting the course of justice A policeman has been jailed for a year for beating a man he wrongly thought had glassed his son. Former Det Con Patrick Lavelle used the police national computer to access the details of his son's attacker. He then broke into Andrew Harrop's address in Preston and punched a man asleep on the sofa - but Harrop was out and the victim was his flatmate. Lavelle, 48, admitted at Liverpool Crown Court to charges of assault and perverting the course of justice. Lavelle, who attends Alcoholics Anonymous, had been intending to attack Harrop, 22, but in fact beat up his flatmate Michael Jones. Despite Mr Jones protesting his innocence, the court heard how Lavelle would not stop hitting him until another flatmate managed to wrestle the disgraced officer off.

Put your hands up to glassing my mate. If you don't we are coming down to sort you out



Stephen Keaney, defendent

Mr Jones suffered concussion and extensive facial bruising. Lavelle, who will be in protective custody in jail, left the flat and phoned Harrop, threatening him to admit the attack on his son. Just an hour later Lavelle enlisted drinking buddy Stephen Keaney, 43, of Malthouse Way, Penwortham, to also phone Harrop to scare him. Martin Reid, prosecuting, said: ""Keaney told Mr Harrop: 'Plead guilty, put your hands up to glassing my mate. If you don't we are coming down to sort you out'."" The attack on Mr Jones happened during the morning of New Year's Eve last year. The day after, Lavelle, a married father-of-three from Bramble Court, Penwortham, realised a complaint had been made at Preston police station and he admitted the offence to bosses. His barrister Anthony O'Donohue described his client's behaviour as ""an aberration"". He said: ""This is a great pity that Patrick Lavelle, two years from retirement and a distinguished career in the police, is being sentenced for these crimes."" 'Own revenge' He argued that as well as his son being attacked, Lavelle's daughter was attacked and sustained a broken arm on the same night and the mental stress had caused him to act out of character. Keaney admitting perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. Harrop, who caused a permanent scar to the officer's son's face, was given a community order after admitting the assault earlier this month, the court heard. Jailing Lavelle, Judge Mark Brown said: ""You were a serving police officer who took the law into your own hands. ""You have lost your job, suffered considerable financial loss and also brought disgrace upon yourself. ""Anyone who abuses his position as a police officer also brings disgrace on the uniform they wear and undermine public confidence in the system."" He added: ""The public look to the police to set an example and you more than most should have realised that taking the law into your own hands is totally unacceptable. ""Having worked for years to make sure the ends of justice were met you decided to wreak your own revenge.""

'Major improvement' in open jails,,[],2009-01-28 10:02:20,"The Robert Foye case fuelled concern about open prisons The case of an on-the-run prisoner who raped a schoolgirl has led to improvements in Scotland's open jails, the chief prisons inspector has said. Robert Foye attacked the 16-year-old in August 2007 after absconding from Castle Huntly open prison near Dundee, raising questions about public safety. Inspector Dr Andrew McLellan said procedures had now been tightened. But his inspection of Castle Huntly, and Scotland's second open prison, Noranside, raised several concerns. Delivering his report on the two prisons, following an inspection in September last year, Dr McLellan said they were failing to offer proper programmes to tackle prisoners' offending behaviour. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. And he said there was ""almost no preparation"" for inmates in closed prisons for a move to open conditions. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he was reassured by the report, adding open prisons were vital in helping offenders back into communities at the end of their sentences. Dr McLellan said no Scottish prison had been the subject of more public concern in the past year than the open estate. He cited public concerns of a lax regime and that open prisons were ""too easy to get into and too easy to get out of"". In 2008, Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years for the rape, which he carried out in Cumbernauld. Mr MacAskill later apologised to the schoolgirl and ordered improvements to the system. 'Decisive moment' Foye was serving a sentence for attempting to murder a police officer when he absconded from Castle Huntly, after being allowed out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Describing his inspection as a ""decisive moment for the future of the open estate"", Dr McLellan said the Scottish Prison Service had learned lessons and ""tightened considerably"" the requirements for admission to open prison. ""This current inspection report demonstrates that significant change has taken place this year in the open estate,"" his report stated. ""Much of the change can be attributed to reaction to that case of rape by an absconding prisoner."" Castle Huntly aims help prisoners back into the community Inspectors said the absconding rate was still high, but dropping, while the number of short-term prisoners had ""reduced considerably"" in favour of long-term inmates preparing to be released. But Dr McLellan said accredited programmes to address offending behaviour should be introduced, while there needed to be more opportunities for inmates' families to better engage with the system before they were given home leave. He said prisoners must be better prepared for moving from closed to open prisons and called for further improvements to community risk assessment procedures. Inspectors issued eight recommendations in all, including calls to improve healthcare facilities at Noranside, in Angus, where milk and coffee was found being stored in the medication fridge. Mr MacAskill said the prison service was already acting on the recommendations. He said of Dr McLellen's inspection: ""I am particularly reassured he has found significant improvements in the risk assessment and risk management of prisoners following the Robert Foye case.""

The court heard that while Cartledge was on home leave from Castle Huntly he had an argument with his partner. He left to stay with a friend and started drinking. When he came to on Thursday afternoon he realised he was supposed to have returned to the jail the day before, and he turned himself in. His previous conviction for absconding from Castle Huntly was shortly after he was transferred there, when he had been given leave after the death of his father. Passing sentence, Sheriff Michael Fletcher said: ""The courts expect someone who is sent to prison to stay there for the time they are sent there. ""I take into account, however, that you were out for one day and made arrangements to go back. The authorities did not have to find you."" Lister, who is on the run from Noranside prison in Angus, was serving a seven year sentence for assaults and robberies. Smyth was sentenced to six years and eight months in 2006 for housebreaking charges. These inmates are meant to be in prison, not wandering around unsupervised in the community

Robert Brown

Scottish Liberal Democrats Calls have been made to review home leave for prisoners after the three cases. The Liberal Democrats said the situation was ""disgraceful"". Scottish Lib Dem chief whip Robert Brown called on Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to look again at the rules on home leave. ""It is reasonable for people at the end of their sentence to move to less formal surroundings as part of the process of preparing for re-entering the community,"" he said. ""But the bottom line is that these inmates are meant to be in prison, not wandering around unsupervised in the community."" A review of Castle Huntly was ordered after a prisoner there, Robert Foye, raped a schoolgirl while on the run in 2007. He had been allowed out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting but did not return to the jail when he was due. The Scottish Government said absconding prisoners were now no longer likely to be sent back to open prison. A spokesman pointed out that the number of absconders from Castle Huntly over 2007-08, 59, was seven less than the previous year. ""In addition to the recommendations contained in the Scottish Prison Service review of the Robert Foye case, there is now a clear presumption against returning a prisoner to the open estate if they have previously absconded,"" he said.

Thousands to try to stop smoking,,[],2007-12-31 00:02:35,"A quarter of people in England smoke

Cancer Research UK analysis of smoking trends since 2006 found January was the most popular month to stop, with an average of one in eight smokers trying.

The charity also said those who tried in January tended to be more successful than those trying in other months.

The NHS is launching a campaign to raise awareness of the free support methods available to help smokers stop.

In the New Year a series of ""Getting Off Cigarettes"" adverts will highlight the range of free stop-smoking support provided by the NHS.

The last available figures showed around 24% of adults in England smoked.

With willpower alone, the chances of success are very small

Professor Robert West

The NHS Information Centre reported in September that more people had stopped smoking in the first three months of 2007 than in any other quarter in anticipation of the smoking ban that came into force in the summer.

Professor Robert West, director of tobacco studies at the Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Unit, calculated that 13% of smokers tried to stop in January 2007 - the equivalent of every adult in Newcastle, Manchester, Coventry and Bristol.

By monitoring trends in quit rates, he also found that those who chose to quit as their New Year's resolution did better than those who quit at other times of the year.

Success

He said: ""We have found that almost half of all smokers actually try to quit at least once over the course of the year and one in eight try to quit in January.

""But I was particularly interested to find that, contrary to popular scepticism of New Year's Resolutions, smokers who quit in January also tended to be more successful at staying off cigarettes.""

He said that many people did not know about the free support that was available to them on the NHS or were put off because they did not know what the services were offering.

""It's not like alcoholics anonymous, it's just practical advice,"" he said.

""With willpower alone, the chances of success are very small.

""The first thing is to get the right medication, whether that's nicotine replacement, zyban or champix, and the really important thing is having it explained exactly how to use it and to make sure you use enough of it.""

Contrary to the NHS Information Centre report, his figures suggest that although people intended to stop because of the smoking ban, the actual number of people smoking has not yet changed.

LA opens new criminal court for troubled veterans,"Los Angeles has convened a new court to handle the growing number of military veterans who fall into trouble with the law, the BBC's David Willis reports.",[],None,"Image caption The programme is limited to veterans charged with non-violent crimes

Los Angeles has convened a new court to handle the growing number of veterans suffering from stress and substance abuse who fall into trouble with the law. The BBC's David Willis meets some of the first to face the judge.

Delton Baker Jr still has the air of a military man.

He stands tall and erect and dresses in a black suit and tie. For eight years his home was the sprawling Camp Pendleton Marine Base near San Diego, California. From there, his regiment saw tours of duty in Grenada, Lebanon and Okinawa.

Then he fell sick, and that was when his problems began.

""I started to find that I had difficulties with my knees,"" Baker, 50, told the BBC.

""They were weak, and it was becoming more and more of a challenge to keep up with the training.""

After his discharge from the military Baker was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Unable to find work, he turned to drink and drugs, and soon fell into trouble with the law.

""I got out of the service and it just seemed as though there wasn't anything for me to do,"" he said.

""So I fell by the wayside.""

Non-violent offences

Baker was the first person to face a judge at the newly launched court for veterans in downtown Los Angeles. As a condition for participation in the programme, he had pleaded guilty to a drug possession charge.

The court, which will convene weekly, caters to former servicemen and women who are suffering from PTSD and other forms of mental illness, such as traumatic brain injury.

The voluntary programme will enable them to receive treatment instead of a jail term. The scheme, which is only open to veterans charged with non-violent crimes, has been tried in other parts of the US and deemed a success.

""This is long overdue,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, who will preside over the veterans' cases, told the BBC.

Image caption An estimated 30% of US troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from some stress disorder

""These people served their country, they stuck their necks out for the rest of us, and some - because of their experiences - are more susceptible to drugs and alcohol and also to mental illness.""

Depending on the nature of their crimes, veterans could be referred to treatment within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) network of outpatient and clinical care facilities.

The veterans will be supervised for a set period of time; if they violate the court's conditions their penalties could be increased.

Former tank commander Alex Barlow, 48, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after his discharge from the US Marines Corps. He spent several years in Los Angeles's notorious Skid Row district, which has a large homeless population, and also turned to drink and drugs.

The second defendant to be brought before the veterans court, he too agreed to enrol in a VA programme after pleading guilty to petty theft. Afterwards, he said he looked forward finally to having a roof over his head.

Homeless veterans

""It's just good to feel that someone recognises I have a problem, rather than that I am a problem,"" he told the BBC.

The VA estimates that 131,000 former servicemen and women are homeless on any given night. In Los Angeles - the city thought to have the largest homeless population in the US - an estimated 8,000 veterans sleep on the streets.

VA social worker Sergio Antoniuk sees a clear link between the large number of veterans sleeping rough and figures suggesting that as many as 30% of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan could be suffering from some sort of stress disorder.

""It's vitally important that these people have their needs assessed, and we draw up treatment programmes so these people can be rehabilitated,"" he told the BBC.

Delton Baker Jr, meanwhile, had already enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous before he came to the veterans court. The judge referred him to the VA for counselling and additional support. He left the court beaming.

""It's good to know that somebody cares for us,"" he said.

""Some of us here have been through a lot, and if you don't have someone to talk to, you bottle up your experiences and that's when the problems arise. I think a lot of us just need someone who will sit down and listen.""","['baker', 'criminal', 'opens', 'stress', 'veterans', 'la', 'programme', 'los', 'angeles', 'treatment', 'troubled', 'court', 'told', 'va']","Non-violent offencesBaker was the first person to face a judge at the newly launched court for veterans in downtown Los Angeles.

Russell Brand takes on Arthur remake,"The BBC's Tom Brook speaks to Russell Brand about taking on the Arthur role made famous by Dudley Moore, along with his co-star Dame Helen Mirren.","['Tom Brook', 'Bbc News', 'New York']",None,"Image caption Russell Brand plays a rich heir with a penchant for drink in Arthur

Comedian turned actor Russell Brand can currently be seen as Arthur, the drunken New York playboy made famous by Dudley Moore in his 1981 romantic comedy.

In recent days Brand has been selling the contemporary remake to US journalists, putting the emphasis on its topicality.

""I think Arthur should be regarded as a fairy-tale prince - a person bestowed with wealth at birth,"" he says.

""In this year of the Royal Wedding, how wonderful to see a romantic comedy focused on a prince.""

Dame Helen Mirren appears opposite Brand, stepping into the late Sir John Gielgud's shoes to play the heir's faithful servant.

Yet where Gielgud was Arthur's butler in the original film, Dame Helen plays his nanny.

Image caption Dame Helen Mirren (r) co-stars as Arthur's nanny in the film

The Oscar-winning actress shares several scenes with the larger-than-life Brand, whom she says was ""utterly disciplined"" on the set.

He may have been well-behaved, but according to Dame Helen there was also room for spontaneity.

""Russell often would improvise. I would more go the route of saying, 'I could say this' and pass it by the writer.""

Dame Helen, 65, sees Arthur as breaking new ground for her in career terms.

""I did it because I'd never done a big, full-out comedy before. I've done films that are comedic, but I've never done a film that is a comedy.""

The actress says she often finds herself ""frightened and intimidated"" on movie sets, as was the case with Arthur.

Surprisingly perhaps, she finds that she is often in awe of the big names with whom she works.

""I get totally starstruck. I can't talk to them and I don't feel good enough,"" she says.

Drunkenness

Brand, 35, says bringing Arthur up to date involved some adjustments, including addressing ""the changing attitude to alcoholism"".

In the original picture, Arthur's constant drunkenness was presented as a harmless indulgence. Now, though, it would be viewed as full-blown alcoholism.

Indeed, the new film depicts Arthur attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Brand, who has admitted his own problems with addiction in the past, thinks his own experiences may have helped him with his portrayal.

One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud Russell Brand

In a move that will alarm some recovering alcoholics, the star reveals that whiskey was on hand while the film was being shot.

""I would carry a bottle of booze about on the set and before takes have a big nostril-full of whiskey to get myself prepared, to evoke the memories of my drunken days,"" says the dandyish joker.

However, Brand insists he was aware of the risks involved. ""Some people said it was dangerous and were concerned about it,"" he reveals.

""But if ever anyone saw me begin to raise it to my lips in an attempt to once more release the demons from within, then people would clutch it pretty quickly.""

US actress Greta Gerwig, best known for her work in independent cinema, plays Arthur's love interest in the film.

In the 1981 version that role belonged to Liza Minnelli, who has been reticent when it comes to the new production.

""It has nothing to do with me,"" the Cabaret star told reporters recently. ""I just think of Dudley so it's difficult for me, thinking of him.""

Mixed reviews

The Arthur remake is raising Brand's profile in the US, but ultimately he wants to make an impact away from the world of entertainment.

""One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud - that reaches beyond entertainment and into philanthropy and altruism.""

Image caption The film has received mixed reviews from US critics

When asked what altruistic deeds he has in mind he says: ""I think I'll have to await opportunities because I'm not a grand social architect.

""I am but a comedian, but I would just like to think that I'm prepared spiritually to be open.""

Arthur performed modesty at the US box office in its opening weekend and has received some damning reviews.

The New York Times referred to the film as a ""grim load of mediocrity"", while other reviewers have described it as bland and muddle-headed.

Many commentators take the view that the original was such a beloved classic that any remake was bound to fall short.

Yet it has some supporters. The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, found Brand ""a worthy successor to Dudley Moore who has a darkness inside him that feels right for the time and for the character"".

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.","['Melissa Hogenboom', 'Bbc News']",None,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism?

In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple.

Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence.

But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment.

Straight vodka

Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from King's College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"".

""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help.""

Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day.

""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything.""

He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"".

""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesn't smell, that you're getting away with it. But of course they did notice.""

Life saver

For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day.

There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert

What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened.

""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup.""

Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night.

Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life.

Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising.

The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time.

But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol.

""Some people can control their drinking after work, others can't. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm.""

A lifetime's worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern.

The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health.

""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as it's a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says.

Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?""

What's a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager

A single pub measure of spirit (25ml)

Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide

This question assesses whether a person's behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds.

""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - I'm not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour.""

There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden.

A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation.

""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter one's mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""","['drink', 'social', 'problem', 'dependency', 'alcoholrelated', 'alcohol', 'baby', 'work', 'problems', 'drinking', 'health']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

Exorcist voice actress dies at 85,,[],2004-03-18 13:05:51,"Mercedes McCambridge lived in San Diego

McCambridge, who was 85, won her best supporting Academy Award in 1949 for her big screen debut in the film All the King's Men.

Other film credits included A Farewell to Arms and Giant.

As well as movie roles she also appeared in TV shows including Cagney and Lacey, Rawhide and Dr Kildare.

McCambridge, who died in San Diego, had a reputation for portraying strong women, playing an enemy of Joan Crawford in 1954 western Johnny Guitar.

It was in 1973 that she was cast as the voice of the possessed child Regan, played by Linda Blair, in The Exorcist.

She reportedly fled the cinema in tears, while director William Friedkin tried to explain there had not been time to add her name.

Actors' union the Screen Actors Guild intervened and forced her inclusion in the credits.

Film work began to dry up in the late 1970s and 80s, but in early 1990s she was offered the role of the grandmother in Neil Simon's play Lost in Yonkers, which she performed 560 times.

Away from acting, McCambridge's life was filled with tragedy.

Her son John Lawrence Fifield murdered his wife and children before killing himself in 1987.

She was also twice divorced and battled alcoholism, which sometimes left her in hospital. But she became sober with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.","['voice', 'screen', 'yonkers', 'film', 'actress', 'exorcist', 'san', 'played', 'blair', 'young', '85', 'work', 'dies', 'won', 'women']","Mercedes McCambridge lived in San DiegoMcCambridge, who was 85, won her best supporting Academy Award in 1949 for her big screen debut in the film All the King's Men.

Attacks 'led to' Gibson outburst,,[],2006-10-14 11:23:05,"Gibson gave the interview to ABC presenter Diane Sawyer

Gibson's 2004 depiction of Jesus Christ's crucifixion had been attacked by Jewish leaders, who said it could incite hatred towards Jews.

He told US TV's Good Morning America he was ""ashamed"" of what he said.

""I was subjected to a pretty brutal public beating. I thought I'd dealt with that stuff,"" he said.

""But the human heart can bear the scars of resentment, and it will come out when you are overwrought and you take a few drinks,"" he told ABC interviewer Diane Sawyer.

In the interview, screened over two days, the actor and director also said his statement to police that ""Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world"" grew out of concerns about violence between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

'Outrageous, drunken statement'

Asked by Sawyer, ""what are the Jews responsible for?"", Gibson replied: ""They're not blameless in the [Middle East] conflict.""

Mel Gibson pleaded guilty to drink-driving

""Let me be real clear, here. In sobriety here, in front of you, national television... I don't believe that Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world,"" Gibson told Sawyer.

""That's an outrageous, drunken statement.""

Gibson himself is a conservative Catholic and has been vocal about his opposition to abortion, birth control and divorce.

He also denied being influenced by his father, Hutton Gibson, who has publicly said he doubts six million Jews were killed by the Nazis.

The interview ended with Gibson saying he needed to ""heal myself"" and ""allay the fears of others and heal them if they had any wounds from something I might have said"".

Kenneth Jacobson, deputy national director of Jewish campaign group the Anti-Defamation League told Reuters he was heartened by Gibson's closing words.

""But I felt that when Diane Sawyer was probing about why he did it, there was a problem because there is a thin line between explanation and excuses, and some of it came close to excuses,"" he said.

Gibson was given three years' probation and told to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after pleading guilty to drink-driving following the incident in Malibu, California, on 28 July.","['led', 'attacks', 'diane', 'gibson', 'outburst', 'jews', 'responsible', 'sawyer', 'national', 'wars', 'told', 'interview', 'world']","Gibson gave the interview to ABC presenter Diane SawyerGibson's 2004 depiction of Jesus Christ's crucifixion had been attacked by Jewish leaders, who said it could incite hatred towards Jews.

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,"['Neil Smith', 'Entertainment', 'Arts Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date

A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars.

Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink.

Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas.

Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.

All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild).

Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances.

'Wonderful imagination'

""I'm very aware my chances are not very high so I'm not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

""But it's lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance I've done, and I certainly can't help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way.""

""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January.

Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad

""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role.""

Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TV's Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kate's free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband.

""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like you're living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old.

""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience.""

Should accolades come in Smashed's direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557).

Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor.

For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge.

Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue.

'Not propaganda'

""What's funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles.

""I was wearing this... 'device', and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it.

""And it wasn't working - every take it wasn't working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, 'Is it going to work?'

""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done.""

Winstead's character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband.

Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help

The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good.

""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult.

""We didn't want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it.

""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate.""

As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winstead's characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation.

Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"".

""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says.

""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation.""

'Recovery point'

Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle.

Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"".

""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who can't get to that recovery point,"" she muses.

Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret

""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories.""

""I think it's funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flight's marketing budget.

""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyone's lives.""

So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest.

""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes.

""I also went onto YouTube and typed in 'drunk people acting crazy',"" he continues. ""It's incredible what you can find out there.""

Smashed is out in the UK and Ireland on 14 December.","['oscar', 'elizabeth', 'winstead', 'alcoholic', 'film', 'playing', 'mary', 'caption', 'smashed', 'paul', 'work', 'won', 'feel']","Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

Presented by Emily Maitlis

If Gulf War 1 marked the first time we watched real conflict in real time on rolling news, perhaps the current conflict will go down in history as the first time The Bloggers, critical of the mainstream media, have successfully challenged the images and coverage that have emerged from Lebanon and Israel.

A Reuters freelance photographer has now been fired from his job after some revealed he had doctored pictures of Beirut in the aftermath of an airstrike. Tonight we examine the propaganda war - what are we not seeing from both sides and how is the censorship affecting our perception overall.

Who is telling the truth? Tell us what you think here.

UN

The seven point plan may sound like an enticement to Alcoholics Anonymous Lite. But tonight we'll try and discuss amendments to the UN resolution without driving you to drink.

Can any changes be subtle enough to keep Israel onboard but substantial enough to win over the Lebanese and Hezbollah? An Arab League team is now heading to New York to put forward their own wording. We'll be testing you on PP3 OP3 not to mention the fun-sounding OP13. But fear not.

ITV

'Is Pammy Preggars?' screams the ITV website, about the former Baywatch Babe.

We're not able to answer that with any certainty tonight, but we can wonder whether its Chief Executive Charles Allan has a little news of his own to break. He is widely expected to resign this evening.

ITV has been losing viewers hand over foot in recent months. Did it fail to strike the technology iron whilst it was hot? Is the fact its Love Island has ended up in need of marriage counselling symptomatic or a root cause?

What a mayor

And finally, the Tories seem to be having a little trouble finding a suitable candidate to take on Ken Livingstone in London and indeed trouble inspiring it's much touted A-list candidates to even apply for any seats. Has Green Dave lost his Midas touch?

Nick Ferrari - the bookies favourite to be Tory mayoral candidate - says he gets on well with Mr Cameron but doesn't really know what he stands for.

He's coming into see us tonight. He's said if he stands he wants to be his own man, even if it means speaking his mind, causing offence and antagonising his party leader.

Shot barrister Mark Saunders' 20-year alcohol struggle,"Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police marksmen, was a ""gutsy and polished"" courtroom opponent - but had his own two-decade struggle with alcohol.","['Nick Beake', 'Bbc London Home Affairs Producer']",None,"Image caption Mr Saunders ended two months of sobriety the day before he died

In the crucible of the courtroom, he was an impressive figure.

Described in one directory of lawyers as ""popular, gutsy and polished"", Oxford graduate Mark Saunders fought on behalf of celebrity clients in high-profile and often acrimonious divorce cases.

But for nearly 20 years, he was struggling to control his alcohol intake.

It was following one heavy afternoon binge in the spring of 2008 that 32-year-old Mr Saunders found himself with a bottle of wine in one hand and a shotgun in the other, firing from the window of his £2m flat in Chelsea.

Police said they feared for their safety and the public's. On Thursday an inquest jury agreed that they had lawfully killed Mr Saunders.

When Mr Saunders began drinking at the age of 13, it was not to escape the reality of a sad and deprived life. Rather, it was in the surroundings of his private school in Cheshire.

After gaining his law degree from Christ Church College, Oxford, and serving with the Territorial Army, he joined the respected QEB Chambers in central London.

But while his profession career soared, his descent into alcohol abuse accelerated.

'Out of control'

By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

He himself admitted he was ""out of control"".

Some weeks he would drink the equivalent of four bottles of spirits. That year, he received a police caution for being drunk and disorderly.

His wife of two years, Elizabeth, also a barrister, told the inquest her husband was a ""sensitive"" man with a ""huge energy and love for life"". They were, she said, ""very much in love"".

Image caption Mr Saunders' marriage to Elizabeth was strained by his drinking

But their marriage was considerably strained by his drinking.

""I know he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous and went there on three or four occasions,"" she told the inquest jury. ""But he felt it wasn't for him, and it didn't work out.

""What Mark wanted to do was control the drinking, to be able to be a social drinker. There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

Mr Saunders' best friend Alex Booth often saw what happened when it did go wrong.

""He completely lost touch with reality,"" he said in a statement.

Mr Booth explained how his friend had ended up in casualty on several occasions, and while drinking he would be ""in a fantasy world, he wouldn't respond or engage with you"".

That fantasy world was often induced by cocaine as well as alcohol.

Tests revealed Mr Saunders had used the drug regularly in the six months before his death - although not within the last 12 hours of his life. His wife knew nothing of his drug habit.

Mr Saunders did recognise he had a problem and sought help. To stabilise his mood swings, he was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac.

In 2006, a psychiatrist examined him and warned that if he did not ""abstain completely from all mind-altering substances"" he could find himself being killed in a fight.

'Bulging eyes'

The other fear, according to medical notes, was that Mr Saunders would commit suicide if a period of depression and an alcohol binge coincided.

In February 2008, he told his wife he was giving up drinking for good. He was sober for the next two months. On the evening of 5 May, he had one glass of wine.

The following day would be Mr Saunders' last.

It is unclear at what point in the afternoon he began drinking, but by the time a taxi driver dropped him off near his home at about 1600 BST, it was evident that he was drunk.

Image caption Mr Saunders was shot as he levelled his shotgun from his flat window

Blood tests would later reveal him to be three times over the drink-drive limit.

David Hay, the taxi driver, said: ""At that point he turned back round and I gave him his change and he was looking straight at me and just said: 'I'm going to die'.""

""When he looked at me his eyes were large and bulging. I could see the terror in his eyes.""

Half an hour later, Mr Saunders loaded the shotgun he legally owned and fired the first shots from his kitchen window, triggering the five-hour standoff with armed officers of the Metropolitan Police's CO19 firearms unit.

When the fatal shots were fired at half past 2130 BST, Mr Saunders was alone.

Police had refused his wish to talk to his family - fearing he wanted to say goodbye and take his life.

Charities in row over water costs,,[],2008-03-03 00:17:12,"The Church of Scotland fears it will have to spend more on water bills

Charities and churches currently have exemptions and reliefs from these charges but it is proposed they will be removed from 2010.

They will then be treated the same as businesses and will face the additional burden of having to pay full charges.

It is estimated that churches could face charges of £1,000 per year.

The campaign coincides with the Scottish Government's consultation on water charges, led by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland.

The organisations involved claim that removal of the exemptions and reliefs will have a crippling impact on many churches and charities.

Disproportionately hit

It is estimated that, depending on the size of their premises, bills could be up to a third of the annual income of some small charities and could force some of them to close.

When the exemptions and reliefs were introduced more than 50 years ago it was recognised that charities and churches played a vital social role in society.

The campaign will include a petition to maintain the current reliefs and exemptions - which will be submitted to the Scottish Parliament - as well as lobbying of organisations including the Scottish Government, MSPs, councils and trade unions.

We are urging the government to show real support for the essential work carried out by charities by maintaining the current exemptions and reliefs

Lucy McTernan SCVO

A motion will also be lodged in the Scottish Parliament.

With the introduction of metering for churches and charities, opponents claim a significant element of the proposed charge will be based on the area of roof and the grounds in which the premises stands.

This means that those premises with larger properties will be disproportionately hit.

Opponents say churches and charities which provide social benefits will be required to pay higher drainage charges than a multinational financial institution, such as a merchant bank occupying a high rent office in a city centre location.

'Additional burden'

Commenting on the launch of the campaign, the Reverend Jock Stein of the Church of Scotland Dunfermline Presbytery, said: ""Church premises are used by all kinds of community bodies, including groups like Mothers and Toddlers, Scouts, Guides and Alcoholics Anonymous.

""Often these bodies simply make an annual donation as and when they are able. As a national church we are extremely concerned about the additional burden of water charges.

""The ending of the current exemption would mean that many congregations will be forced to either reduce services, start charging or hike their existing rates. That in turn might be the last straw for some of these community groups, so there is a big knock-on effect.""

Lucy McTernan, director of corporate affairs for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), said it was hearing from concerned charities across the country.

""At a time that they are being required to deliver more of the Scottish Government's social justice agenda, we are urging the government to show real support for the essential work carried out by charities by maintaining the current exemptions and reliefs"", she said.","['charges', 'costs', 'premises', 'church', 'scottish', 'reliefs', 'current', 'charities', 'exemptions', 'row', 'water', 'churches']","The campaign coincides with the Scottish Government's consultation on water charges, led by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland.

Ms Aherne, who rose to fame as a core member of the BBC TWO comedy programme, The Fast Show, was voted top BBC ONE personality at last year's British Comedy Awards.

But despite her success on the small screen, she has suffered a turbulent private life after splitting with her husband, the New Order bass player Peter Hook.

Andy Harries, controller of comedy at Granada Television, which makes her shows, said he was sure the comedienne could overcome her problems.

She had joined a social running club with her husband and used to go for drinks with friends after the run.

To begin with her drinking increased without her realising - but it rapidly became more important than anything else.

It also became a way to cope with a job that was becoming increasingly stressful.

""I was drinking at lunch time to help me cope with stressful clients in the afternoon, and I was waking up hung over, which increased the stress,"" she said.

The main thing that convinced me I was an alcoholic was when I tried to stop drinking and I couldn't

The problem escalated to a stage where she was drinking at least a bottle of wine a day, was suffering memory loss and black outs, and was trying to hide the true extent of the situation from her husband.

She had to resort to looking at the Radio Times in the morning to find out what she had watched the previous night.

""In the end you need to drink to peel potatoes, dial a telephone number even. You need to drink for anxiety, for everything,"" she said.

Severe pain

At the age of 39 Christina began to have severe abdominal pain. Initially it was diagnosed as gall stones.

But by the age of 45, following an appointment with a new gastroenterologist, she was diagnosed with pancreatitis caused by alcohol abuse, gastric varices - dilated veins in the stomach which can be a life threatening cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding - a severe fatty liver, and alcohol dependency syndrome.

At that stage she had been drinking a bottle of vodka everyday, and she had also lost her job after being caught drinking in the office - a huge blow to her pride.

But even at that point Christina still could not believe she was an alcoholic.

""The main thing that convinced me I was an alcoholic was when I tried to stop drinking and I couldn't,"" she said.

""The thought of dying of pancreatitis, the loss of my job, and the fear of losing my marriage motivated me,"" she added.

Christina went to her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in January 2003, after half a bottle of vodka to help her with the nerves.

""The great thing about it was I could see people in the meetings that were well. They were living examples of what I could be. So I copied them.""

Barrymore evidence over sex claim,,[],2005-09-15 16:29:08,"Michael Barrymore said his assistant was present throughout the meeting

The presenter, who now lives in New Zealand, appeared before Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday via a satellite link in the case of Lee O'Brien.

Mr O'Brien, 23, of Liverpool, is accused of making false allegations he was sexually assaulted by Mr Barrymore when he visited his Essex home in 2001.

He denies three counts of perverting the course of justice.

Mr Barrymore, who appeared under his real name of Michael Parker, was a prosecution witness, but had to defend himself against accusations of drug abuse, making unwanted gay passes and ""risk-taking"".

It's a pack of lies. He lives in a fantasy land. It's very sad

Michael Barrymore

He told the jury that Mr O'Brien, who is deaf, had visited his bungalow unannounced and uninvited.

The star was just about to leave to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, but invited Mr O'Brien in after being told he had driven from Liverpool with some flowers.

Mr O'Brien was invited into the kitchen, given a cup of coffee and a signed photograph, and thanked politely for the flowers, the court heard.

Mr Barrymore insisted the meeting lasted five to 10 minutes, and that his assistant, Jean Swetman, was present throughout. He denied that anything untoward took place.

Under cross-examination by defence barrister Jeremy Benson QC, Mr Barrymore was asked about the events of 31 March 2001, when Stuart Lubbock drowned during a party at his home.

Repeated denials

He admitted smoking cannabis on the night in question, but insisted it was not his cannabis.

Mr Barrymore repeatedly denied taking cocaine and said he did not know how traces of the drug came to be in the master bedroom.

He denied offering cocaine to another man at the party.

The ex-TV star also denied making a pass at the same man by kissing him full on the lips as they lay on the bed smoking cannabis.

He denied the assault and said of Mr O'Brien's allegation: ""It's a pack of lies. He lives in a fantasy land. It's very sad.""

Bullish Barrymore plots comeback,,[],2003-02-12 11:51:12,"Former presenter Michael Barrymore says he sees no reason why he should not return to television.

The 50-year-old former Strike It Lucky host was dropped by ITV in September last year.

There has been intense media coverage since 31-year-old butcher Stuart Lubbock was found dead in his swimming pool in March 2001.

Speaking to Sky News on Saturday as he set up a branch of Alcoholics Anonymous in his local village hall, Barrymore was adamant he had done nothing wrong and should be allowed to revive his career.

He said: ""Why shouldn't I? I've never been charged with anything. I haven't done anything.""

The former alcoholic has already been attending AA meetings for the last 20 months, and is now helping 30 others in Roydon, near Harlow, Essex.

He said: ""We are all on an equal basis in there. The anonymity side doesn't really apply to me here because I'm not anonymous.

""I don't do this for a PR exercise.

""People come here off their own bat, it's not something I seek to advertise and I happen to be a member of it.""

Victim's injuries

Police announced last month they were launching a new investigation into the death of Stuart Lubbock, who was found dead in the star's swimming pool.

An inquest heard that Mr Lubbock, 31, suffered injuries suggesting he may have been the victim of a sexual assault.

Now officers will look into suggestions by Barrymore's lawyer that Mr Lubbock suffered the injuries at hospital after his death rather than at the star's home.

Rapist 'met open jail criteria',,[],2008-03-18 17:39:54,"Robert Foye raped a teenage girl after absconding from an open jail

Robert Foye, 28, admitted raping the 16-year-old in Cumbernauld in August last year after absconding from Castle Huntly, near Dundee.

But a Scottish Prison Service review of the case said Foye met the criteria to be transferred there.

Ministers have been urged to make a statement to parliament on the issue.

Foye was half way through a 10-year sentence for attempting to murder a policeman in 2002 when he absconded after being allowed out of Castle Huntly to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

This is an astonishing report, one which should cause the Scottish Prison Service to hang its head in shame

Bill Aitken

Tory justice spokesman

The prisoner, who also absconded from the jail in 2005, had been on the run for about a week when he raped the girl on a path.

The government-ordered review of the case found Foye posed a ""high-risk of re-offending"" and absconding was a possibility, but fitted the criteria for transfer to an open prison from a standard one.

But the investigation pointed out Foye mostly had a criminal history of dishonesty and car crime, not sexual offences.

Scottish Prison Service chief executive Mike Ewart said lessons would be learned from the review, which made a series of recommendations on improving the system.

""While the conclusions indicate the particular offence [Foye] was convicted of could not have been predicted, there are points of learning to be gleamed from this exercise and we will make sure these are implemented,"" he said.

Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said the recommendations were being introduced ""as a matter of urgency"", but pointed out it was never possible to eliminate risk.

""Nothing can make up for the victim's horrendous ordeal in this disturbing case,"" he added.

Scottish Tory justice spokesman Bill Aitken urged Mr MacAskill to make an emergency statement in the Scottish Parliament on the ""inadequacies"" of the Scottish Prison Service.

""This is an astonishing report, one which should cause the Scottish Prison Service to hang its head in shame,"" he said.

""The contradictions and assessments made in the report are truly alarming.""

Foye absconded from Castle Huntly before committing the rape

Pauline McNeill, Labour's justice spokeswoman, added: ""Robert Foye is a convicted violent drug user with a record of absconding and still the prison authorities decided it was appropriate for him to go to Castle Huntly.

""How the same prison authorities can now claim the open estate was a suitable place for him is absolutely beyond explanation.""

The Liberal Democrats' Margaret Smith said ministers must not allow the prison service to ""wash its hands"" of the Foye case, adding: ""I am concerned that our open prisons are being used as a temporary solution to prison overcrowding.""

The review recommended seven changes in prisoner transfer to open prisons, including better risk assessment for absconding and improved training for prison staff.

Foye, who admitted the rape charge at the High Court in Glasgow last month, is to be sentenced in May.

Meanwhile the Scottish Government's prisons commission, which is considering the role of open prisons, will report in June.","['met', 'foye', 'service', 'criteria', 'absconding', 'open', 'scottish', 'castle', 'prisons', 'review', 'prison', 'rapist', 'jail', 'report']","But a Scottish Prison Service review of the case said Foye met the criteria to be transferred there.

Child porn surgeon can still work,,[],2003-08-28 15:51:26,"Lattimer had been placed on the sex offenders' register for five years

Christopher Lattimer was suspended from practising for nine months at a General Medical Council hearing on Thursday.

The 40-year-old had admitted downloading the images out of ""sexual curiosity"" on three different occasions while drunk.

The hearing heard that Mr Lattimer, of Wallington, Surrey, was ""clicking on everything before him"" during the internet sessions.

These offences related to child pornography in which vulnerable children are abused and by accessing such sites you are encouraging its perpetuation

Manny Devaux, committee chairman

In February the surgeon pleaded guilty to 10 counts of making indecent photographs of children and asked for 40 similar offences to be taken into account.

He was sentenced to three years community rehabilitation which depended on him receiving psychotherapy, pursuing treatment for alcohol addiction and attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.

'Completely unacceptable'

Mr Lattimer's psychiatrist Dr Graham Rehling told the hearing there was no evidence the surgeon posed a risk to patients.

Concluding the hearing committee chairman Manny Devaux said he accepted Mr Lattimer's reasons for accessing the images were not paedophilic but said it was completely unacceptable.

He said: ""These offences related to child pornography in which vulnerable children are abused and by accessing such sites you are encouraging its perpetuation.""

Mr Devaux said the committee determined while it was inappropriate for him to practice medicine at this time, it would be disproportionate to erase his registration.

Actor leaves court a sex offender,,['Matt Prodger'],2007-08-02 21:32:42,"By Matt Prodger

BBC News



Langham denied he was a paedophile

He left it in the back of a prison van, his name on the register of sex offenders and awaiting sentencing on 15 counts of making indecent images of a child - in other words, downloading child pornography.

Throughout his trial he had denied the charges. To plead guilty would have meant, he said, admitting he was a paedophile ""which I am not"".

But he admitted looking at child pornography online and gave two explanations for what he did.

The first was that he was researching a character, a sex offender, for the TV series Help.

The second, he said as his voice shook, was that he himself had been sexually abused as a child, and he had been drawn to the internet images of abuse ""because it's an issue in my life"".

Juror wept

It was dismissed as ""pseudo-psychobabble"" by prosecutor Richard Barraclough QC and the judge said neither explanation provided a legal defence.

When the jury were shown parts of the clips he had downloaded, one member wept.

Langham starred in the BBC's political satire The Thick of It

In court Langham cut a repentant but often articulate figure, describing a life troubled not only by incidents of abuse as a child, but problems with drink and drugs before he gave both up in the 1980s.

He described how therapy and Alcoholics Anonymous had saved his life. He broke down once, when he described the impact his arrest had on his family.

""I just wanted to die and I tried to kill myself,"" he said.

The jury cleared him of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of serious sexual assault on a girl who was just 14 when the alleged crimes were to have begun.

Family support

Now a woman aged 25, she had gone to police after she heard media reports of Langham's arrest on suspicion of possessing child pornography in 2005.

Hidden from the defendant by a screen in court, she told the jury she had met the actor when he appeared in a theatre production of Les Miserables.

He took her to some of London's top restaurants and bought her expensive gifts. But her allegations that he had sex with her in his dressing room, in hotels and at his home did not convince the jury.

At times throughout the trial his three adult sons, each bearing a startling resemblance to the actor, sat at the back of the public gallery.

Moments before the verdict, Langham smiled and nodded to them.

After the verdict Detective Inspector Derek Cuff spoke outside the court on behalf, he said, of those whose voices had not been heard inside - the children sexually abused in the production of ""harrowing"" pornography which Langham had, by viewing, helped perpetuate.","['counts', 'trial', 'offender', 'actor', 'langham', 'verdict', 'sexually', 'jury', 'sex', 'court', 'child', 'leaves', 'pornography']","But he admitted looking at child pornography online and gave two explanations for what he did.

Living in the grip of alcohol,Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has started drinking again. How difficult is it to fight alcohol addiction?,"['Michelle Roberts', 'Health Editor', 'Bbc News Online']",None,"Image caption Paul Gascoigne has an ongoing battle with alcohol

Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol.

The 45-year-old was shaking and slurred his words on stage at a charity event in Northampton on Thursday and his agent, Terry Baker, says he now fears for Gascoigne's life.

Alex Best, widow of football legend and recovering alcoholic George Best who died in 2005, is also concerned.

She told The Sun newspaper: ""Seeing Gazza in such a bad way brings back the most horrible memories of George when he was in the grip of the drink that eventually killed him.

""It's heartbreaking to see Paul so deeply gripped by his addiction again.""

Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager

Dependency

NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence.

Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

You don't necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging.

Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health.

Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol.

Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work.

""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or poor.

Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol

Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start

Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning

Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol

""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink.

""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. That's when it becomes a problem.""

For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example.

She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path.

Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect.

Breaking the cycle

Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same.

Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step.

""It sounds simple but, in reality it's not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it.""

The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade.

Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries

Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers

Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job

It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings

Gazza's drinking problems started during his playing days.

In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems.

In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldn't be seen as a failure.

""It's important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it.

Dennis' story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasn't drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldn't remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AA's 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol.

""Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end.

""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. It's important not to give up.""

She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where it's ""stop drinking or die"".

Help on hand

But for others, abstinence is never an option.

Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health.

""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking.

""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least it's a month.""

She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control.

""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services.""

Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work.

Langham 'groomed vulnerable girl',,[],2007-07-12 12:38:38,"Mr Langham denied the charges

Mr Langham at court

Mr Langham, 58, of Kent, has denied 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of a serious sexual offence on a girl under 18 between 1996 and 2000.

He also denies 15 counts of making an indecent image of a child in 2005.

The court heard police raided his home in 2005 and found images of young girls ""being degraded and sexually abused"".

Prosecuting, Richard Barraclough QC said Mr Langham, of Golford, near Cranbrook, had an ""interest in young girls"".

Defending, David Whitehouse QC, said his client admitted having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim when she was an adult - but the relationship she claimed to have had with him ""never happened"".

He said his client had downloaded child pornography on four specific dates.

David Whitehouse QC said he had been writing a series called Help, for the BBC, in which he played a psychiatrist, and used the material for an episode about a paedophile.

Hotel rooms

The court heard that the actor and his alleged victim bonded over Shakespeare and her desire to act.

The married father-of-two bought her a copy of The Merchant Of Venice, took her to art galleries and dinner at The Ivy, and introduced her to his family, said Mr Barraclough.

He said Mr Langham took advantage of a ""vulnerable"" girl, whose parents had split up, and had an unhappy childhood which was ""devoid of affection"".

""She began to confide in him,"" he said.

""He did all sorts of things for her, even paying for her to get help with her eating disorder.""

Their first contact was a kiss on the lips when she was 14, jurors were told, ""under the guise of teaching her the correct way to breathe"".

Adding that Mr Langham had a drink problem, he said the pair had sex in hotel rooms in London and when he was away filming, and in cars.

Chris Langham starred in BBC TV series The Thick of It

Defending, David Whitehouse QC, urged the jury to keep an open mind.

He said his client admitted having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim after the period covered by the charges, when she was an adult.

He said: ""After that he tried to distance himself from her. This was a big mistake, as big a mistake as having had sex with her in the first place, because she cannot cope with rejection.

""The sexual relationship she says she had with him never happened apart from that.""

He said Mr Langham admitted taking her to hotels and restaurants but said they had not had sex.

The actor had been helping her with her problems using his own experiences from his time with Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Whitehouse said: ""He helped her, supported, he guided her.""

Teens want alcohol advice on web,,[],2004-02-16 00:23:07,"Teenagers worry doctors may 'judge' their drinking habits

Experts from the University of Otago in New Zealand said young people did want to find out how to drink safely.

But writing in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, they say young people dislike talking to doctors because they worry they will be judged.

Targeting individuals with information, by post or email, was also highly effective, they said.

Young people are curious about how risky their drinking is and how it compares with that of their peers

Dr Kypros Kypri, University of Otago

Dr Kypri said: ""Our research suggests that young people who are not seeking treatment for an alcohol problem would be disinclined to discuss their drinking with a health practitioner through fear of being judged.

""Young people are nonetheless curious about how risky their drinking is and how it compares with that of their peers.

""Computerised approaches capitalise on this curiosity while reducing the potential that young people will be put off by the prospect of having to discuss their drinking and its consequences with a health practitioner.""

Face-to-face help

A trial where doctors wrote directly to 1,600 college students was found to be an effective way of getting information to them.

Dr Kypri said it would be even more effective if email was used.

And he said where health professionals did have the opportunity to see a young person to talk to them about their drinking, even a short consultation could help.

""It is generally impracticable for a health practitioner to deliver a one-hour intervention to a young person whose drinking is risky.

""Ten to 15 minutes of assessment and advice in the waiting room, however, may be quite deliverable to a large proportion of individuals with hazardous-drinking habits.""

Addiction service to help doctors,,['Jane Dreaper'],2008-11-18 08:44:53,"By Jane Dreaper

BBC News health correspondent

Drink and drug problems are relatively common among doctors Doctors and dentists who have an addiction or other health problems often leave it late to seek help because they fear being recognised or worry about putting their career in jeopardy. But the launch of a specialist service on Monday may help push them to seek the treatment they need. The government-funded project expects to see 500 cases a year. It's already been getting inquiries before the formal launch. The idea of specialised help was proposed by the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, some years ago. But it gained momentum after inquiries into the serial killer GP, Harold Shipman, and other doctors who've mistreated patients. GP-run The service - named the Practitioner Health Programme - is based in a normal GP practice, near a busy transport hub in central London. However, doctors and dentists who turn up here won't have to linger in the waiting area as confidentiality is a key priority. The consulting room is more like a psychiatrist's study, with comfortable chairs and a coffee table.

The over-riding emotion that doctors and dentists feel is guilt - guilt at having let themselves, their patients and their families down

Dr Clare Gerada There is no computer sitting between the doctor and patient, and no examination couch. Addiction to drink or drugs is expected to be a common concern. By the time health professionals acknowledge that they need help, they're likely to be highly distressed - so up to two hours are set aside for an initial assessment. The GP running the project, Dr Clare Gerada, said: ""The over-riding emotion that doctors and dentists feel is guilt - guilt at having let themselves, their patients and their families down. ""Because they don't approach the normal avenues for help, their problems get complex. ""If we feel a doctor or dentist is putting their patients at risk, we have a legal responsibility to discuss it with them. FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

More from Today programme ""We could even talk to their employer or the General Medical Council as a last resort. ""But if they're not working, then there won't be a risk to patients."" It's expected that most doctors and dentists will need to take sick leave while they tackle their problems. Most patients are expected to be from within the M25 - but this is just the pilot, and officials in Scotland have expressed an interest. Recovery Alasdair, who's based near Edinburgh and wants to be known by his first name only, believes he knows up to 2,000 doctors in the UK who are recovering well from an addiction and practising medicine safely. He helps NHS staff who ring a helpline run by volunteers at the Sick Doctors Trust, and believes the new service will be highly valuable. Alasdair began drinking heavily as a medical student. These doctors who've been exquisitely well trained at treating patients have not been especially well prepared for managing many of their own complicated life problems

Dr Michael Kaufmann As a doctor in his thirties, he was sometimes downing ten pints of beer a night. He said: ""I thought I was magically protected against the diseases I treated. ""And I was frightened that if anyone found out I was an alcoholic, I'd be drummed out of the profession. ""Things were getting risky in the work setting. ""It's difficult to be precise, but my judgement wasn't as good as it should have been. ""I got help through Alcoholics Anonymous and have now been sober for many years. Life's good - beyond my wildest dreams."" Harold Shipman's horrific crimes have led to an overhaul in the way doctors are managed and regulated. Experts have long argued that successfully protecting patients must mean helping doctors to stay healthy, though it's a tricky balancing act. The hope is that a specialised service will encourage those who might put patients in danger to seek help at an early stage. Dr Michael Kaufmann is a visiting expert who set up a similar project in Ontario, Canada. His message is that demand can only grow. He said: ""When I started in 1995, it was just me alone in an office, with a computer I had no idea how to use. ""Today we have a staff of 12, and we're looking for more. We respond to addiction, but also to many broader issues. ""These doctors who've been exquisitely well trained at treating patients have not been especially well prepared for managing many of their own complicated life problems.""

Reality TV slot for Barrymore,,[],2003-01-30 18:32:50,"Entertainer Michael Barrymore has talked about a possible television comeback during a surprise appearance on the Channel 4 reality TV show, The Salon.

The star talked about his future while he enjoyed a haircut and pedicure on the fly-on-the-wall show.

He revealed he had been asked to appear in a television drama but said he had not yet decided if he should accept the offer.

There isn't a problem in the world that can't be sorted out

There isn't a problem in the world that can't be sorted out

Michael Barrymore



Barrymore's appearance on The Salon is one of his first forays back into television since the death of Stuart Lubbock, the 31-year-old who was found drowned in the star's swimming pool in March 2001.

Channel 4 has promised more celebrity appearances on The Salon, which features a fully working hairdressers and beauty parlour run by 11 full-time staff.

Barrymore's arrival was shown live on E4 and he fidgeted as he waited for his appointment with stylist Adee.

Asked by Adee why he had agreed to appear, Barrymore replied: ""Because you asked me and I wasn't doing anything else.

He claimed to be considering a ""great format"" for a new show and said he would return to TV ""when the time is right"".

Barrymore added he was keeping himself busy in the absence of a TV career.

""There isn't a problem in the world that can't be sorted out,"" he said.

""There are a lot of things I can do apart from TV.

When the conversation turned to Barrymore's battle with alcoholism, the entertainer said he had been ""clean and sober for 20 months"" and was still attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Internal injuries

Barrymore recently said the support of the public had kept him from descending into a ""pit of depression"" after the death of Mr Lubbock.

Mr Lubbock was found floating in a swimming pool at Barrymore's Essex home and declared dead in hospital shortly afterwards.

The cause of his death has still not been established.

Police announced earlier this month they were launching a new investigation into Mr Lubbock's death.","['slot', 'tv', 'isnt', 'talked', 'death', 'problem', 'reality', 'sorted', 'television', 'cant', 'barrymore', 'swimming', 'world']","Entertainer Michael Barrymore has talked about a possible television comeback during a surprise appearance on the Channel 4 reality TV show, The Salon.

Nine years for on-the-run rapist,,[],2008-10-01 11:32:34,"Robert Foye raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison A man who raped a 16-year-old schoolgirl after escaping from an open prison has been jailed for a minimum of nine years. Robert Foye carried out the attack in Cumbernauld last year after absconding from Castle Huntly prison near Dundee. He was serving a sentence for attempting to murder a police officer. Foye, 28, has also been placed on a lifelong restriction order which means that if released from jail, he will be strictly supervised and tagged. At the High Court in Edinburgh, the judge, Lady Smith, sentenced him to life imprisonment and ordered him to serve at least nine years behind bars. His teenage victim was in court to see her attacker sentenced. Foye, who admitted the rape charge at an earlier appearance at the High Court in Glasgow, had been on the run for almost a week when he carried out the rape. READ THE REPORT

Read Lady Smith's full sentencing statement [29KB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here He had been allowed out of Castle Huntly to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. It later emerged that Foye had absconded from the open prison on a previous occasion in 2005. The court heard that the 28-year-old lived rough in woods, drinking heavily, before he seized the girl in broad daylight as she returned from Cumbernauld town centre after collecting new contact lenses on 24 August last year. Lady Smith noted that in spite of her ordeal the girl had achieved good exam results and was on course to achieve her goal of going to university. But, the court heard, the teenager is still afraid of men, needs counselling and has only felt able to attend school part-time. The judge told Foye: ""You subjected her to not only physical violence but degrading sexual violation which has had a devastating effect on her."" Foye was given day release last August although he had previously been on the run, had failed a number of drug tests and had been ""on report"" for other breaches of prison discipline, the court heard. Public apology Lady Smith said: ""I do not have enough information to comment on the appropriateness or otherwise of you in your circumstances, having been placed in Castle Huntly and allowed day release."" When details of the rape first emerged earlier this year, concerned MSPs raised the case with First Minister Alex Salmond at Holyrood. In March, Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill offered a public apology to the schoolgirl for the ""shortcomings within our prison system that have allowed this individual to put her through such pain"". He has also warned that any inmates absconding from open prison in future are likely to be sent back to a normal jail. Sentencing on Foye had been delayed on a number of previous occasions while background reports were being prepared, including detailed psychological and psychiatric tests. Lady Smith said their conclusions persuaded her that he was a danger to the public, and would continue to be so until he changed his life. The judge imposed a form of life sentence which will keep Foye behind bars until he is thought to pose no further risk to the public and which will then keep him under strict supervision for the rest of his days. You subjected her to not only physical violence but degrading sexual violation which has had a devastating effect on her

Judge Lady Smith Only a handful of such ""orders for lifelong restriction"" have been issued since the courts were given such powers in June 2006. Foye was convicted in 2002 of the attempted murder of a police officer, when he was given a nine-and-a-half-year sentence. Lady Smith was told two police forces were trying to track him down last August after he failed to return from his day out. Advocate depute Jennifer Bain, prosecuting, told how Foye asked his victim the time, then seized her, clamping a hand over her mouth and forcing her into woods near Dowanfield Road between Cumbernauld Village and Seafar. Miss Bain told how the girl pleaded with Foye not to have sex with her, but he ignored her pleas. Afterwards he walked away, telling the girl, who was covered in bruises and scratches, not to leave until he was gone. She ran away through a field. Defence QC Paul McBride said that although it may be little or no consolation to his victim, Foye's distress and disgust at what he had done was ""heartfelt.""

Ad drive launched by celeb clinic,,[],2003-10-02 11:02:46,"The Priory is launching its first national ad campaign

The Priory clinic has assisted Ronnie Wood, Paula Yates and former England footballer Paul Gascoigne.

Although fees at the clinic are thought to run to thousands of pounds a week, it is offering free assessments for people with drink and drugs problems.

A spokesman said it was trying to ""draw attention"" to mental health problems.

The Priory clinic in Roehampton, Surrey, is the best-known of its 16 treatment centres across the UK.

Other celebrities who have called on its services in the past include television presenter Michael Barrymore, model Kate Moss and writer and actress Caroline Aherne.

Fees for a week's stay for some clients reportedly approach £2,500 in some cases, although the clinic is keen to stress that every individual treatment package attracts a different price.

One of the adverts placed in the national press depict a smudged list of comments made by drinkers - followed by the line: ""If this is all you can remember about last night, call the Priory"".

Helping out

The Priory's spokesman, corporate communications manager Karen Croft, told BBC News Online that the company was publicising a helpline number - but it was not the intention to turn every caller into a client.

She said: ""It could be that The Priory is not the most suitable place to help them - we might direct them to their GP, or perhaps to Alcoholics Anonymous, if that would work better for them.""

""These people will be offered a full assessment of the type we offer to everyone who wishes to become a patient - including taking a brief medical history.""

She said: ""Our intention is to discover the extent of the problem and recommend the best course of action.

""We are simply hoping to raise awareness of the huge problem of alcohol and drug addiction in society.""

A spokesman for Alcohol Concern said that it still feared the Priory would be too expensive for many who took up the offer of the free assessment.

""People will have to pay or go back to the waiting list,"" said a spokesman.","['ad', 'clinic', 'problem', 'drive', 'priory', 'free', 'launched', 'spokesman', 'national', 'treatment', 'offer', 'intention', 'list', 'celeb']","The Priory is launching its first national ad campaignThe Priory clinic has assisted Ronnie Wood, Paula Yates and former England footballer Paul Gascoigne.

Lindsay Lohan's chequered life in the spotlight,"As actress Lindsay Lohan is given a prison sentence for probation violation, a look at the Hollywood star's career and troubled life lived in the spotlight.",[],None,"Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010

The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

The 24-year-old wept into her lawyer's shoulder in a Los Angeles courtroom as she was handed a 90-day prison sentence for probation violation, relating to a drugs charge dating back to 2007.

Lohan's life in front of the lens began at a very early age.

Born Lindsay Dee Lohan in the Bronx, New York, on 2 July, 1986, she became a child model at the age of three, appearing in Vogue, Elle and a string of television commercials for the likes of Pizza Hut and The Gap.

Image caption Lohan shot to fame as a fresh-faced Disney film star

By the age of 10, she had landed a role in US soap opera Another World, a fertile breeding ground for new talent, which also give early roles to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

Lohan made her feature film debut just a year later in squeaky clean Disney hit The Parent Trap.

Her life in film progressed smoothly and wholesomely, with critically-approved comedy roles in Freaky Friday, teen hit Mean Girls and Herbie Fully Loaded adding to her profile.

Annus horribilis

A fresh-faced Lohan picked up an impressive clutch of Teen Choice and MTV Movie Award gongs.

She branched out in 2004, becoming the youngest host of the MTV award ceremony, and developed an increasingly high profile away from the confines of Hollywood's film sets.

Her apparent weight loss and a string of car accidents created tabloid headlines, and the paparazzi began to trail the young star around Los Angeles.

Lohan, meanwhile, continued to diversify. She had sung the closing song in Disney's remake of Freaky Friday, which resulted in a record contract.

Her debut album, Speak, was released in 2004 and made it to number four in the US album chart.

Image caption Lohan (left) won high praise for her role in fish-out-of-water high school comedy Mean Girls

Her follow-up a year later also proved a hit, and was a more soul-searching, confessional record about her relationship with her family, which she admitted had been a difficult one.

Songwriting, Lohan said, was a way of finding escape from the increasing pressures of her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl.

Cameo roles followed in more adult-orientated films, including A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby - but Lohan's reputation for enjoying the high life grew in 2006 when she was rebuked for late arrivals on the set of the film Georgia Rules.

The film's producer suggested in a letter, leaked to the press, that the actress's ""heat exhaustion"" was simply the result of ""ongoing all night heavy partying"".

She began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and admitted herself to a rehabilitation clinic in early 2007 - in what proved to be an annus horribilis for the star.

Lohan was arrested twice for driving and drug offences and had two more stints in rehab. A jail sentence was imposed but she spent only 84 minutes behind bars, and was forced to visit a mortuary to learn the impact of drink-driving.

While her personal life was splashed across the front pages, her film career was hitting a low point.

Grisly psychological thriller I Know Who Killed Me was mauled by the critics - The New York Post branded it ""sleazy, inept and worthless - and Lohan was given the dubious honour of a Razzie award for worst performance.

Image caption Lohan's liaison with Samantha Ronson was followed closely by the press

Subsequent years saw Lohan drift into smaller TV roles, including fronting a BBC documentary about child trafficking, while the tabloid headlines kept rolling in.

She had a much-publicised relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson, but refused to answer questions about her sexuality.

The couple's subsequent break-up saw Lohan take the unusual step of putting out a spoof video dating advert, introducing herself as ""a workaholic, a shopaholic and, according to the state of California, an alcoholic"".

Lohan also joked about her ongoing probation and the ever-growing number of Google searches about her private life.

In recent months, the actress has gained further notoriety for brushes with the legal system and her apparently wayward lifestyle.

She missed a routine court appearance, unable to return from the Cannes Film Festival after losing her passport. An initial warrant for her arrest was later revoked.

After a stint in jail and court-ordered rehabilitation, the future looks uncertain for Lohan.

Lohan had been lined up to play 1970s porn legend Linda Lovelace, a world away from the squeaky clean roles which originally propelled her into the spotlight.

South Park creators talk comedy,,['Kevin Young'],2006-08-28 10:45:16,"By Kevin Young

Entertainment reporter, BBC News



South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have given a masterclass at the Edinburgh TV Festival, explaining the routine they follow to make their satirical animated comedy.

It's changed somewhat, but what's remained constant is that we write, direct and produce every single episode and do all the voices.

Parker (l) and Stone (r) have written South Park since 1997

A week before the show airs, we don't even know what the show is going to be - which is cool because we can do exactly what is happening that week.

It's also really stressful. It keeps it exciting.

We'll have a big writers' retreat before every season and it will hopefully come up with a few big ideas. But it's still that Thursday that we sit down and say, 'What show will we do?'

More often than not, we don't have any ideas.

Sometimes we'll come up with, OK, alcoholism - what's our take on Alcoholics' Anonymous.

We'll start to figure out whose story it is, and come up with a scene and start a scene, because you've got to get something animated.

It's really more of a sculpting process.

More often than not, we don't have any ideas



On Friday we'll come in and say what happens before that, or what happens after that, or is that the beginning?

On Saturday it builds up, and Sunday it builds up.

Then on Monday we're dying - oh my God, the show is on in two days and we don't have anything.

And then on Tuesday we're up all night and we always used to barely having it by Wednesday morning - and then it's on the air.

We can sit there on Monday night - literally this happens all the time - and we won't have an ending. We don't have the last four minutes of our show.

We'll figure it out, and then we can run to the booth, we do all the voices, send it up to animation - it all happens in one building.

We'll even write the pages knowing this is kind of it, this isn't it, and then we'll animate that, and we'll think, 'Oh, Cartman shouldn't say that, he should say this.'

The often controversial show is set in a small town in Colorado

We can write a scene and go, 'OK, now we've done this, let's put this whole scene not at Cartman's house but outside, in a Chinese restaurant.' And we can see that in an hour.

Meanwhile the storyboard department will draw a big board so I can take it and put the drawings where I want, so that tells the animators what to do.

We learned to write about three years into South Park. It's fun because we've still stuck with the show and we still do everything ourselves.

Now we go back and look at our early work - you know, 10 years ago.

It's pretty rough watching the first couple of seasons - like, 'Oh wow, we thought [at the time] that was good writing.'

Career highs and private lows for Langham,,[],2007-08-02 15:39:58,"Chris Langham's Bafta win was overshadowed by child porn charges

Only one year ago Chris Langham was accepting a Bafta award for his comedy acting in the BBC political satire The Thick of It.

On the same night he shared another award with co-star Paul Whitehouse for their series Help, featuring a therapist and his clients.

It was the pinnacle for Langham, who had won genuine stardom following a chequered career interrupted by alcohol and drug addictions.

But instead of his name being remembered for his acting and writing skills, Langham is likely to be remembered for his conviction for child porn offences.

It was just three days after his Bafta award that police charged Langham with the child pornography offences. Four months later he was accused of abusing an underage girl, a charge he was acquitted of in court.

The actor, from Golford, near Cranbrook, Kent, vowed to clear his name. But some industry observers say his conviction could spell the end of a television career that has spanned nearly 40 years.

Langham's first break in TV came nearly four decades earlier, on Spike Milligan's Q in 1969.

It will now be very difficult to disassociate his work from his private life

Alkarim Jivani, Time Out magazine

In the 1970s he was the sole British writer on The Muppet Show, and he shared an Emmy Award in 1981 for the hit programme.

He was then part of the original team behind the groundbreaking Not The Nine O'Clock News, but he was dropped at the end of the first series as a dependency on drink and drugs developed.

Genuine stardom would elude him for another 25 years.

Jurors at the trial heard about Langham's battle with drink and drugs, including how he went on to become an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) mentor to a number of friends.

A BBC reporter in court said he spoke candidly and confidently when giving evidence - that his experience of AA meetings had clearly got him used to talking about himself.

In a 2006 interview with The Guardian prior to being charged, he admitted that cocaine and alcohol helped him suppress his anxieties and attain the approval he craved.

Jurors at Langham's trial laughed when a clip of Help was shown

""As long as I was drinking and being quite hyperactive, there was a lot of stuff about me that I didn't know,"" he told the newspaper.

""I find life quite difficult and if it weren't for tools that I use that allow me to get through the next hour, I don't know how I would deal with it.""

He eventually sobered up and a drink and drug-free Langham began to rebuild his reputation during the 1990s, writing and appearing in Kiss Me Kate and Bremner, Bird And Fortune.

But it was not until he appeared in Help and The Thick Of It that he became anything close to a household name.

Now Langham will struggle to be associated with anything other than this court case, says Time Out critic and broadcaster Alkarim Jivani.

""The irony is up until now he has been a comedian's comedian and after this he will gain more notoriety for the things that have emerged in court than he ever did for the success he had as a result of his considerable talents.

""It will now be very difficult to disassociate his work from his private life, and once it's impossible to avoid noticing the man behind the make-up it's fatal for a performer's career.""","['drink', 'career', 'lows', 'langham', 'help', 'bafta', 'private', 'difficult', 'award', 'langhams', 'court', 'child', 'highs']","Chris Langham's Bafta win was overshadowed by child porn chargesOnly one year ago Chris Langham was accepting a Bafta award for his comedy acting in the BBC political satire The Thick of It.

Rocker Lee free again,,[],2000-05-31 12:46:40,"Pamela Anderson's estranged husband, Tommy Lee, has been freed from a jail term imposed after she reported him for drinking.

The 37-year-old rocker was ordered to spend five days behind bars for breaking a probation order which banned him from alcohol.

A court heard the incident happened over the New Year, but Anderson did not report it until three weeks ago.









Lee, the former drummer with US rock band Motley Crue, was jailed for six months in 1998 for assaulting Anderson. He was released on probation, with a condition imposed that he did not drink. This time around, the court ordered him to enrol in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme. Drinks Lee's lawyer, Harvey Slovis, said he had shared a couple of drinks with Anderson in another bid to patch up their stormy marriage. Slovis claimed the former Baywatch star did not report her husband until earlier this month, when the pair had another falling out. He added: ""He's hoping that you don't report him as a mad rocker out doing bad things.

The Wonderful World Of The Whips,,[],2006-04-10 11:16:12,"Daniel Brittain reports to the Daily Politics on the power the whips wield over their parliamentary colleagues, and how they exercise it. Let me introduce you to the Wonderful World of Whipping: a dark, satanic place, where knowledge is power, and power is wielded by the Whips. Parliamentary observers have been describing their black arts since 1662. And ever since then, they've been using a diabolic mixture of threats, cajolery, and just the teeniest bit of torture to get their party's way. Eyes and ears 300 years ago, the Whips were the eyes and ears of the King in the Commons. THE DAILY POLITICS You may need to remind them that they did have a mistress, but the wife never found out.

Former Whip Gyles Brandreth Even today, three of the Whips hold appointments in the royal household. One of them, the Vice Chamberlain, sends a little message from the Commons to the Queen every evening. The government and opposition each have around fifteen Whips, responsible for different areas. Their essential role is to whip their back-benchers into order. Floozies and boozies But what about their methods? Don't worry yourselves that subtlety is part of the equation here. What's important is control. And they have so many methods at their disposal. Former Conservative Whip, Gyles Brandreth, gave me some examples: You may need to remind them that they did have a mistress, but the wife never found out. You may need to remind them that you were the person who took them to their first meeting at Alcoholics Anonymous, and not a whiff of it got into any of the newspaper diaries.

As recently as the nineteenth century, the Whips were in charge of the Secret Service Fund; nothing to do with military intelligence, this was an account that helped out MPs in financial trouble - in exchange for their support. When things get really desperate - the government's majority small; the policy unpopular - a Whip will need to use the severest methods. The Enforcer John Major had a lot of trouble forcing the Maastricht Treaty through the Commons. Fortunately, he had the services of the super-large David Lightbown, a former military policeman known endearingly as The Enforcer. He would just lean on recalcitrant Tory MPs - quite hard. At the same time, a government needs to make sure all its supporters vote - even if they should really be in hospital. Little left in the armoury? John Major had to rely on summoning back an almost immobile Julian Critchley for crucial votes. Today, in spite of her name, the government Chief Whip Hilary Armstrong appears to have lost control of her back-benchers, who feel that their views aren't getting through to the PM. Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody told me about times when it's more difficult: The reality is that Whips can only physically deliver people who are acquiescent in some form or another. If ministers listen to the difficulties - if ministers respond - the Whips can bring the people in. Whips can't change minds; they can only count heads.

The tried-and-tested methods of persuasion no longer seem to be working as they once did. With key votes hanging in the balance for the government, there seems to be little left in the Whips' once-powerful armoury to enable them to turn the screws.

"15,500 pints to save football club",,[],2002-12-02 16:55:15,"A cash-starved football team has agreed to down more than 15,500 pints of beer to pay off huge debts - to a brewery.

County Durham club Willington AFC's entire squad and management team are sinking as many pints as possible to slash the debt that threatens to close the ground.

The club owes thousands of pounds to a brewery and are in danger of going under.

But in a bizarre deal, brokered by an MP, the brewery has agreed to swallow up the debt if the club can sell more ale.

Between them the club's players and diehard fans will have to drink 15,634 pints to clear the £3,800 debt.

The storm-in-a-pint glass saw the Albany Northern League Second Division outfit threatened with a court battle by drink suppliers InterBrew if the money was not paid within seven days.

That would have seen the 96-year-old club penniless and evicted from its ground.

Chairman John Phelan said: ""We'll all be ringing Alcoholics Anonymous by Christmas.

""There was no way we could have afforded that kind of money. It would have finished us off. We were then offered a payment plan which would have stretched us to the limit.

""Our players and supporters end up in the club house after the match and usually have just one or two pints.

Loan agreement

""But they are going to have to get their hands in their pockets and guzzle the beer like never before if they want to keep the team.

""Normally we like our players to keep off the drink because it slows them down on the pitch.

""We had to get the debt down and this is as good a way to do it as any of us can think of.""

The club had a loan agreement with InterBrew of £3,779 but when the contract was ended by the club, InterBrew demanded the full payment up front.

It threatened the club's survival, but Durham Labour MP Hilary Armstrong stepped in and acted as mediator.

A monthly payment scheme has now been set up and for every keg of 36 gallons - 288 pints - sold, the club will have £70 slashed off the bill.","['drink', 'debt', 'pints', 'players', 'payment', 'way', 'team', 'football', '15500', 'save', 'threatened', 'interbrew', 'club']","A cash-starved football team has agreed to down more than 15,500 pints of beer to pay off huge debts - to a brewery.

Barrymore quits comeback show,,[],2003-09-19 09:44:28,"Barrymore's career was halted by the death of Stuart Lubbock

Minutes before he was due to appear in his stand-up comedy show on Thursday night, he told producers he could not go on.

Barrymore apologised to fans, citing ""personal reasons"" for failing to appear at a London theatre.

It was his first UK performance since the death of Stuart Lubbock in his swimming pool two-and-a-half years ago.

The pressure of the last two years has taken its toll

Michael Barrymore

Barrymore, 51, had hoped to relaunch his career with a scheduled a seven-week run at the Wyndham's theatre in the West End, but ticket sales have reportedly been poor.

Despite getting a standing ovation on his first night, he received some bad reviews from critics.

In a statement Barrymore said: ""Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologise to everyone who has bought tickets, but the pressure of the last two years has taken its toll.

Barrymore's manager said he would not be quitting showbusiness

Producer Steve Berrick said: ""Michael has withdrawn for personal reasons. We completely understand. All monies will be refunded and we wish Michael all the best for the future.""

Barrymore's manager, Diana Howie, said he would be taking a holiday but insisted he would not quit showbusiness all together.

""He will be back with new stuff, but obviously he needs to have a proper break and recover from the pressures of the last few months,"" she said.

Before his attempted British comeback, Barrymore had performed a live tour in New Zealand and Australia, where he had proved hugely popular.

Ms Howie said he had received a number of offers of work from the two countries, and might return there.

""He's got interest from all sorts of different fields and it's really a case of doing the right thing for him rather than doing the first thing that is offered,"" she said.

However, before his opening night in London, Barrymore had suggested he might consider quitting showbusiness if the show was a failure.

""But I'm not going to crumble down into a heap,"" he said. ""Maybe I'd go to the other side of the camera and try that.""","['thing', 'stuart', 'night', 'comeback', 'quitting', 'barrymore', 'taken', 'received', 'showbusiness', 'pressure', 'reasons', 'quits']","Barrymore apologised to fans, citing ""personal reasons"" for failing to appear at a London theatre.

Addiction court hears first case,,[],2008-01-28 09:22:57,"The court will deal with families affected by drug and alcohol abuse

Based on a US model, the court will deal with family cases where addicted parents are neglecting their children.

It will not hear criminal cases but will fast-track parents to treatment and recovery with support from therapists and social workers.

Mentors, who have themselves been through the courts, also offer support.

Co-ordinated action

Three London councils - Westminster, Islington and Camden - have combined to set up the initiative, which will sit at the Inner London Family Proceedings Court.

The three-year pilot will cost more than £1.3m, with just under £900,000 coming from central government and the rest from the three boroughs.

The focus will very much be on therapy and recovery and so therefore on the longer-term interest of the child

Bridget Prentice

Justice minister

Currently two-thirds of children taken into care in inner London have parents with drug or alcohol problems.

Justice minister Bridget Prentice said: ""Cases will be brought to court earlier wherever a parent is suspected of substance or alcohol abuse.

""And during the course of the case, the focus will very much be on therapy and recovery and so therefore on the longer-term interest of the child.""

She added: ""If we can take a step towards ending the misery drugs and alcohol abuse causes families, that can only be a good thing.""

The concept of the court is American and relies on swift and co-ordinated action from drug experts, social workers and housing professionals.

The judge could order parents to attend one-to-one counselling or group sessions to avoid having their kids taken into care.

Specialist district judge Nick Crichton, who has campaigned for such a court for the past five years, said: ""We are confident that the pilot court will be able to make a significant difference to the lives of the children whose cases will come before us, and we are excited that at last the project is about to start.""

He said the court would not focus solely on detoxifying the parent, but seek at the same time to understand the other problems that could be contributing to their situation.

These could include abusive relationships, debt, mental health problems, learning difficulties, and housing issues.

The court could recommend visits to the housing department, Alcoholics Anonymous sessions, and even advise ending abusive relationships.

""To some extent we might have to be uncomfortably directive,"" Judge Crichton said.

Parents' progress will be monitored by the same judge every two to four weeks - a point emphasised by Judge Crichton as key to the pilot's success.

'Keeping children safe'

In the US, the courts have a high success rate of keeping children with their parents after they have received help.

Westminster councillor Sarah Richardson said: ""This new court process will give us the chance to intervene and support the family unit rather than take it apart, by helping parents through treatments and recovery.

""This, we hope, will keep both the child safe and the family together.""

The project will be evaluated by experts from Brunel University to see if parents on its programme are more successful in tackling their substance abuse.

It will also monitor whether children of addict parents can safely remain at home, or if the scheme helps youngsters in care be returned to their parents.

Judith Harwin, professor of social work at Brunel University, said there were two problems with the existing policy of dealing with addictive parents.

In cases of illegal drug use, such as crack or heroin, authorities had ""far too speedy a response"" to remove the child before ""parents have a chance to show whether they can address their problems"".

In other cases, such as alcohol abuse, the case comes to court ""far too late"". The child can already be suffering from neglect and is more difficult to place with an alternative family.

""This means the child may drift in care for a long time"", which could have poor outcomes for their future education, health and employment prospects, Professor Harwin said.","['social', 'hears', 'case', 'addiction', 'judge', 'children', 'parents', 'cases', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'child', 'court', 'family']","The court will deal with families affected by drug and alcohol abuseBased on a US model, the court will deal with family cases where addicted parents are neglecting their children.

Spotlight on domestic abuse laws,,[],2008-07-29 13:14:55,"Proposed reforms of laws governing murder have been prompted by concerns about the different treatment of men and women in domestic violence cases. It could mean a new defence in cases of prolonged abuse, the abolition of the 17th century defence of provocation and a more precise definition of diminished responsibility. Over the years, a number of high profile cases have put a spotlight on the law. Here are a few of them. KIRANJIT AHLUWALIA Kiranjit Ahluwalia was jailed in 1989 for killing her violent husband. Ms Ahluwalia's story has been turned into a film She had suffered 10 years of rape and abuse by her husband and after he threatened to burn her with a hot iron, Ms Ahluwalia threw petrol over her husband's duvet and set it alight while he was sleeping. He died 10 days later of his injuries and Ms Ahluwalia was charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. A key reason for the failure of her plea of provocation, which would have reduced the crime to manslaughter, was the time that had elapsed between her husband's last attack on her and her retaliation. Her case was taken up by the pressure group Southall Black Sisters and after a retrial she was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility, sentenced to the time served already and released in 1992. Her appeal set a historic precedent - that women who kill as a result of severe domestic violence should not be treated as cold-blooded murderers. Ms Ahluwalia's autobiography inspired the 2007 film Provoked, which starred Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai and British actor Robbie Coltrane. SARA THORNTON Sara Thornton was jailed for life in 1990 for the murder of her alcoholic husband Malcolm. Ms Thornton pleaded guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility The police had been called to the home on numerous occasions when she was being assaulted and an Alcoholics Anonymous representative saw her violent husband punch her. A neighbour said he had witnessed her husband ""beat her black and blue"" and she was admitted to hospital unconscious. According to pressure group Justice for Women, he had threatened to kill his wife and her daughter in their sleep. Fearing for their life, she stabbed him once and called an ambulance. She pleaded guilty on grounds of diminished responsibility and was found guilty of murder. In this case, the judge said she could have walked out or gone upstairs. In English law there is currently only one full defence to murder - self defence. Two other partial defences - provocation and diminished responsibility - reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter. In order to plead provocation you have to show that you killed following a sudden loss of self control. In 1996, Ms Thornton's murder conviction was changed to manslaughter and she was granted freedom. EMMA HUMPHREYS In 1985 Emma Humphreys, aged 17, was jailed for the murder of her violent boyfriend Trevor Armitage. Ms Humphreys served 10 years in jail A former prostitute, Ms Humphreys had a troubled upbringing and had suffered months of severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her pimp Mr Armitage. She stabbed him when she thought he was about to attack her again - but did not tell the murder trial about the abuse. Ms Humphreys contacted Justice For Women in 1992 after seeing media coverage of the Sara Thornton and Kiranjit Ahluwalia campaigns. In 1995, after a decade in prison, the Court of Appeal reduced her conviction to manslaughter and she walked free. After her release, she was a campaigner for Justice for Women but died three years later after overdosing on a sleeping drug. The organisation set up a memorial prize award in her memory. JOSEPH MCGRAIL In 1991, Joseph McGrail was tried for the murder of his wife. He pleaded provocation on the basis that his wife was an alcoholic and swore at him. He killed her by repeatedly kicking her in the stomach while she was drunk. The judge expressed his sympathy with Mr McGrail, saying: ""This lady would have tried the patience of a saint"". He was given a two-year suspended sentence and walked free. LES HUMES Les Humes stabbed his wife Madeleine 12 times in 15 minutes in front of her children after she confessed to an affair with her karate instructor. In 1992, the court heard how their teenage daughter tried to seize the knife from Mr Humes as he repeatedly stabbed her mother. Mr Humes, who said in court he ""just saw this red mist"", was jailed for seven years after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted an admission of manslaughter and dropped murder charges.

Matthew O'Donoghue, 43, of Birchgrove, Swansea, dragged the girl into a dark alley as she screamed to her boyfriend into a mobile phone.

O'Donoghue was jailed for five years at Swansea Crown Court on Friday.

In 1993 the ex-US Navy sailor was sentenced to 10 years for strangling a woman while trying to force her into sex.

The jury heard that the latest offence involved kidnapping a university student in Swansea.

Christopher Clee, prosecuting, said O'Donoghue approached the girl while she was walking through the city centre at midnight in May.

He spotted her trying to phone her boyfriend and having difficulty getting through. He offered to let her phone from his car, but she refused and walked off.

O'Donoghue followed her, grabbed her arm and pulled her into a secluded alleyway as she screamed frantically for help.

""He was seen by two women who called the police,"" Mr Clee said.

Victim's trauma

The court heard that O'Donoghue ran off but was later arrested by the police.

He later claimed he had drunk 14 pints of beer and had not been fully aware of his actions - and that his motives had not been sinister.

A statement from the victim said : ""I still feel traumatised in relation to what happened"".

She said she had been left feeling fearful of going out and had great difficulty sleeping.

Police inquiries into O'Donoghue's past revealed he had lived in the States and had a prison record, and had also been thrown out of the US Navy for unspecified infringements.

He had been found guilty of a sex offence in Maryland.

""Putting it into English he strangled a female in order to have sex with her,"" said Mr Clee.

""The sentence imposed was 10 years and he served four years of that before being released.""

Mr Clee added that O'Donoghue had later been deported from America in March 2000 for unspecified reasons.

Catherine Richards, defending, said the latest attack had taken place at a time when O'Donoghue had been drinking to excess.

He now recognised the seriousness of what he had done, and was aware that he had destroyed his chances of starting afresh in Britain.

He was, however, willing to enrol on any courses for sex offenders while in prison, and had already voluntarily joined Alcoholics Anonymous.

Judge Michael Burr said he had seriously looked at the possibility of a life sentence because of the risk of O'Donoghue re-offending.

He said he had no doubt that the kidnap was done with the intention of carrying out a ""very serious sexual assault.""","['odonoghue', 'unspecified', 'swansea', 'sentence', 'attacker', 'later', 'clee', 'screamed', 'struck', 'sex', 'trying', 'prison', 'usa']","In 1993 the ex-US Navy sailor was sentenced to 10 years for strangling a woman while trying to force her into sex.

Life inside a sex addiction clinic in the UK,,[],2010-04-05 03:05:32,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. UK sex addiction clinics are reporting a rise in the number of people seeking help, a fact being linked to golfer Tiger Woods admitting his affairs. BBC Reporter Gavin Lee was given access to one of the few sex addiction clinics in the UK. The group begins in a similar way to how I'd expect an alcoholics anonymous meeting to start. The clients sit together in a circle, and the first to speak is 27-year-old Danny James from Liverpool. ""Hi, I'm Danny. I'm a sex addict."" Danny used to live in Blackpool and speaks openly about how he destroyed his relationship with his girlfriend and daughter because of his addiction. ""You could liken it to a drug. The hit after sex, I'd start to need that feeling more and more. After a while that feeling wouldn't last as long so you'd do it again and again. ""I started losing work, because I was concentrating on going out finding people to sleep with. Every day, I'd be straight into a pub, on the job and it wasn't that hard to find in Blackpool cause it's what most people come here looking for anyway, with hen nights and so on. It was kind of put on a plate."" Childhood issues That cycle led to Danny breaking up from his partner and losing contact with his daughter. He lost his business and says he was depressed and disgusted with himself. ""It was only from going to therapy I realised there was something wrong. With me, there was a lot of back issues from my childhood. We went into those issues and rebuilt my life. ""I know it sounds daft but I did things like going to the zoo with somebody and just learn how to be normal again."" It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts

Danny, sex addict Danny attends the Steven Pope Therapy Clinic in Blackpool every week, which costs him £40 an hour. Paul is another self-confessed sex addict. He is a quiet member of the group and is reluctant to take part in discussions. He said it started through boredom when he started to search for explicit content on his computer, which led to buying hundreds of DVDs and magazines. He described his condition as obsessive, which also led him to become deeply depressed. 'Woods effect' The centre has taken on 52 new clients in the past two months, compared with only a handful each month last year. This rise appears to be reflected across the small number of sex addiction clinics in the UK. Therapists say the many new clients have cited celebrities such as Tiger Woods as the inspiration for them to seek help. Golfer Tiger Woods' many affairs have been highly publicised Steve Pope, who owns the therapy clinic in Blackpool, says the interest from people wanting help has been unprecedented. ""People are now coming forward to talk their issues through. Woods on one side has been to hell and back, as his family has, but he's saved lives and that's the Tiger Woods effect."" The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity, a professional body set up to support research into sex addiction, has also recorded a rise in the number British clients seeking help. Paula Hall, who is in charge of the service said many professionals were now looking for further training in this field. ""They're having more and more clients coming to them looking for services and up until now there's been little or no training for this in the UK."" 'Troublesome' behaviour The treatment in the UK is based on methods used in the US where sexual behaviour therapy is big business. However, the term is not technically recognised as a medical illness. Professor Glen Wilson, a specialist in sexual behaviour at Gresham College, dismisses the idea that it could be an addiction. ""Whatever the celebs have we all think we ought to have as well, and of course the drug companies will want to get in on the act too. Once a behaviour has been medicalised they will come up with pills for it,"" he says. I think to say that sex addiction doesn't exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day

Paula Hall, psychotherapist ""There are tremendous pressures on medicalising behaviour which is no more than troublesome. It's not the same as drug addiction because it's not a hijacking of the circuits by a chemical, it is what the circuits were set up for. ""That is rewarding you for sexual behaviour which has reproductive and survival significance."" Many medical experts hold a similar opinion towards the term sex addiction. But Paula Hall, who's a trained psychotherapist, says she vehemently disagrees with their analysis and believes the problem has not been researched properly. ""The people out there still saying this does not exist do not understand the condition. ""It is not about sex, it's about that dependency and that compulsion, and I think to say that sex addiction doesn't exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day."" Despite the lack of recognition for the term sex addict, the clients in Blackpool say for them the addiction is all too real. The feelings are put into some perspective when I ask Danny what he thinks his life would be life without therapy. ""I'd be dead,"" he says. ""There's no two ways about it. ""It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts. I would have gone through with it. I'd be dead.""

Alcohol 'nearly killed me',,[],2002-02-28 15:23:02,"Alcohol 'nearly killed me'

Alcohol misuse is costing the NHS up to £3bn a year, with more than 28,000 hospital admissions caused by alcohol dependence or poisoning. Peter is a 31-year-old reformed alcoholic whose drinking habits began when he was still at school. He started drinking at the age of 12 and ended up in a mental hospital by the time he was 23 after an alcohol-fuelled fit, which nearly claimed his life. This is his harrowing story. ""At the age of 13, I would drink before going out to discos. ""I would get my Dad to buy cider for me and say it was for me and my friends and then drink it all myself. ""By the age of 16, I was down at the pub every Friday and Saturday and I would have a few cans during the week. ""When I got my driving licence at 17, I was drinking and driving.

I was drinking a bottle of whiskey a day and that's when I started to get ill

Peter, former alcoholic ""I got caught twice, once aged 20, when I got an 18-month ban and then when I was about a week away from getting my licence back, I got caught again and got a three-year ban."" By the time he was 18, he was regularly drinking 12 pints a night and often driving home from the pub. He worked during his gap year before starting university and spent most of his earnings on alcohol. By the time he reached the University of Exeter he was spending his grant cheque and any extra money from his father on booze. Hallucinations He ran up a £6,000 debt during his time there and in his final year reading politics, he was drinking round the clock. He said: ""I was drinking a bottle of whiskey a day and that's when I started to get ill. ""I was underweight because I wasn't eating much and I was having hallucinations. ""My gums would always be bleeding and I used to have a pain like acid indigestion which meant I couldn't sleep lying down at night. I had to prop myself up. ""My mental state was deteriorating. As I got towards my finals I felt suicidal. ""I was drinking before exams in the morning."" On leaving university, he started work, but the drinking continued and it began to affect his mental state with frightening consequences. Delusions He said: ""I would have auditory and visual hallucinations and terrible fears that people in my office were the devil. ""I had delusions that the company I was working for was full of vampires. ""I was drinking about 400 units of alcohol a week. ""One day I went on a huge drinking spree in London and my Dad came to rescue me and take me home. ""I woke up the following morning and had an extreme case of DTs, delirium, massive hallucinations and a heart rate going through the roof.

My sister said it looked like a scene from the Exorcist

Peter, former alcoholic ""I was literally climbing up the walls. ""The ambulance crew wanted to section me, but they agreed to take me to hospital. ""The doctors told my Dad if I had arrived four minutes later I would have had permanent brain damage and seven minutes later and I would have been dead. ""I was in A&E, strapped onto a trolley. ""My sister said it looked like a scene from the Exorcist. ""When I started screaming out 'whiskey' they knew what had happened. ""I was taken from there to the local mental hospital where I was dosed up to the eyeballs with medication."" He was diagnosed with alcohol-induced psychosis, but walked out after a week. Alcoholics Anonymous His GP put him on Diazepam - a prescribed drug used to treat anxiety disorders. He was saved from his spiral of alcoholic destruction by friends, who suggested he attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He had one drink after his first meeting in November 1995, but has not touched a drop since. Looking back on his health during this time he said: ""Sometimes I felt that I was dying and if I had another fit, I would die in Broadmoor. ""Physically I had no obvious problems, but there were times when I was bleeding and found blood in my underwear. ""It would terrify me, but I wouldn't see a doctor. ""I would be aware my kidneys were aching like crazy when I wasn't drinking. ""I had lots of shakes and I was coughing up blood at times."" He says his health is now ""A1"" and a scan showed his liver has not been damaged despite the abuse. He is now looking forward to staying clean and with the continued support of AA, he hopes he will never be tempted to go back.","['nearly', 'alcoholic', 'whiskey', 'university', 'hallucinations', 'alcohol', 'mental', 'started', 'hospital', 'killed', 'drinking', 'week']","Alcohol 'nearly killed me'Alcohol misuse is costing the NHS up to £3bn a year, with more than 28,000 hospital admissions caused by alcohol dependence or poisoning.

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. The struggles of Mitch and Janis Winehouse to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of couples up and down the country.,"['Chris Summers', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption In the film Trainspotting, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is put through ""cold turkey"" by his parents

The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouse's battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country.

Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?""

Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work.

His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic.

Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, 'It's finally got her'.

'Slave to the addiction'

""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son.""

Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009.

Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009

A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year.

Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse.""

She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouse's death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but it's still raw.""

Ms Moore said: ""I've read stuff on Facebook about Amy like 'one less junkie', and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, 'How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it'?""

""What people don't realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death.""

She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin.

Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse.

""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore.

Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse.

Tough love

They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons.

The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"".

But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works.

He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism:

Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic.

Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol.

Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit.

Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist.

Image caption Mitch and Janis Winehouse had to deal with their daughter's addiction amid the public's gaze

At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive.

""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriend's house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldn't cope with it,"" said Mr Methven.

He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table.

""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital.

""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser.""

Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent.

He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD.

Out of control

But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it.

Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance.

""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father.

Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral.

""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private.""

Jason has been into rehab twice.

There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic

On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink.""

He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it.""

Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money.

'Secretive' drinking

""It's always secretive drinking. He doesn't go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said.

Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking.

""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today it's four. He is still drinking but it's far less,"" said Mr Methven.

But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop.

Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean

""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. It's a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether.

""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough.""

Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""It's not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life.""

While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death.

Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts.

Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit.

Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son.""

She said she met Amy's mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected.""

Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

Plan to monitor all internet use,,['Dominic Casciani'],2009-04-27 13:50:15,"By Dominic Casciani

BBC News home affairs reporter

Social networks: Data recorded - but not content Communications firms are being asked to record all internet contacts between people as part of a modernisation in UK police surveillance tactics. The home secretary scrapped plans for a database but wants details to be held and organised for security services. The new system would track all e-mails, phone calls and internet use, including visits to social network sites. The Tories said the Home Office had ""buckled under Conservative pressure"" in deciding against a giant database. Announcing a consultation on a new strategy for communications data and its use in law enforcement, Jacqui Smith said there would be no single government-run database. Communications data is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies to track murderers and paedophiles, save lives and tackle crime

Jacqui Smith

Home Secretary But she also said that ""doing nothing"" in the face of a communications revolution was not an option. The Home Office will instead ask communications companies - from internet service providers to mobile phone networks - to extend the range of information they currently hold on their subscribers and organise it so that it can be better used by the police, MI5 and other public bodies investigating crime and terrorism. Ministers say they estimate the project will cost £2bn to set up, which includes some compensation to the communications industry for the work it may be asked to do. ""Communications data is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies to track murderers, paedophiles, save lives and tackle crime,"" Ms Smith said. ""Advances in communications mean that there are ever more sophisticated ways to communicate and we need to ensure that we keep up with the technology being used by those who seek to do us harm. ""It is essential that the police and other crime fighting agencies have the tools they need to do their job, However to be clear, there are absolutely no plans for a single central store."" 'Contact not content' Communication service providers (CSPs) will be asked to record internet contacts between people, but not the content, similar to the existing arrangements to log telephone contacts. REASONS TO CHANGE WHAT CAN BE KEPT More communication via computers rather than phones Companies won't always keep all data all the time Anonymity online masks criminal identities More online services provided from abroad Data held in many locations and difficult to find Source: Home Office consultation But, recognising that the internet has changed the way people talk, the CSPs will also be asked to record some third party data or information partly based overseas, such as visits to an online chatroom and social network sites like Facebook or Twitter. Security services could then seek to examine this data along with information which links it to specific devices, such as a mobile phone, home computer or other device, as part of investigations into criminal suspects. The plan expands a voluntary arrangement under which CSPs allow security services to access some data which they already hold. The security services already deploy advanced techniques to monitor telephone conversations or intercept other communications, but this is not used in criminal trials. Ms Smith said that while the new system could record a visit to a social network, it would not record personal and private information such as photos or messages posted to a page. ""What we are talking about is who is at one end [of a communication] and who is at the other - and how they are communicating,"" she said. HAVE YOUR SAY This is a waste of time and money on an unprecedented scale Sean, Manchester Existing legal safeguards under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act would continue to apply. Requests to see the data would require top level authorisation within a public body such as a police force. The Home Office is running a separate consultation on limiting the number of public authorities that can access sensitive information or carry out covert surveillance. 'Orwellian' Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: ""I am pleased that the Government has climbed down from the Big Brother plan for a centralised database of all our emails and phone calls. ""However, any legislation that requires individual communications providers to keep data on who called whom and when will need strong safeguards on access. ""It is simply not that easy to separate the bare details of a call from its content. What if a leading business person is ringing Alcoholics Anonymous, or a politician's partner is arranging to hire a porn video? ""There has to be a careful balance between investigative powers and the right to privacy."" DATA CONSULTATION

Download the document [676 KB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The big problem is that the government has built a culture of surveillance which goes far beyond counter terrorism and serious crime. Too many parts of Government have too many powers to snoop on innocent people and that's really got to change. ""It is good that the home secretary appears to have listened to Conservative warnings about big brother databases. Now that she has finally admitted that the public don't want their details held by the State in one place, perhaps she will look at other areas in which the Government is trying to do precisely that."" Guy Herbert of campaign group NO2ID said: ""Just a week after the home secretary announced a public consultation on some trivial trimming of local authority surveillance, we have this: a proposal for powers more intrusive than any police state in history. ""Ministers are making a distinction between content and communications data into sound-bite of the year. But it is spurious. ""Officials from dozens of departments and quangos could know what you read online, and who all your friends are, who you emailed, when, and where you were when you did so - all without a warrant."" The consultation runs until 20 July 2009.

Isle monk defends couple sacking,,[],2005-01-06 13:49:14,"Brother Robert said job losses were needed 'for the good of the island'

Andrew and Sally McHardy, who lost their jobs after 23 years on Caldey Island, claim unfair dismissal.

Brother Robert, one of 14 monks who spend much of their lives in silent contemplation, told an employment tribunal there was less work for them.

He also told the Carmarthen hearing the abbey was under pressure to cut wages.

Mr McHardy, 60, was a cook and handyman to the monks while his wife, 58, had domestic duties included repairing their habits.

But the couple were made redundant and told to leave their cottage when younger monks took over their duties to cut costs at the monastery, which is three miles off Tenby.

Brother Robert, 71, described how he was allowed to speak at the tribunal despite their vows to lead a ""near-silent"" life.

He told the tribunal in Carmarthen: ""It's not actually a vow of silence. If it was then I wouldn't be allowed to say anything today.

Sally and Andrew McHardy have said they wanted fair treatment

""It does make the place quite silent. We do have a vow to stay in our monastery and live modestly, but also to obey, which is why I'm here.""

Brother Robert said the monks from the Reformed Cistercian Order - which dates back to the 17th century - tried to live a self-sufficient lifestyle but had to create jobs for the McHardys because of an initial shortage of trained monks able to work.

'Financial pressure'

He said the monastery, set up in 1929, was also under financial pressure to cut the wages bill on the island, which mainly makes its money from tourism.

Brother Robert said sacking the McHardys ""had to be done for the good of the island.""

He said: ""They were fully aware of the redundancy and had no objections at the time.""

Brother Robert added however that the monks were concerned about Mr McHardy's heavy drinking.

The monks survive by making perfume and chocolate at the abbey

Mr McHardy was in charge of the island guesthouse for pilgrims on retreat, where alcohol including wine and beer was allowed.

Brother Robert said: ""The guests must have wondered how Mr McHardy could afford the amount of alcohol he was consuming.

""At one stage, I had to make it clear to our suppliers that we wouldn't pay for any alcohol sent to the guesthouse.""

He added that the drinking had ""become a concern"" to other monks on the island.

""There was talk behind his back that he was drinking heavily. A number of members of the community were concerned including two who were members of Alcoholics Anonymous and were conscious of this problem,"" he said.

Brother Robert, who is the procurator in charge of finances at the monastery, admitted there was no consultation with the McHardys.

He said: ""It seemed to be unecessary in the sense that there was nothing we could do about it. We couldn't afford to employ them any longer.

""We weren't going to replace them so what was there to consult about.""","['island', 'mchardy', 'tribunal', 'monk', 'couple', 'cut', 'monks', 'alcohol', 'told', 'monastery', 'isle', 'mchardys', 'robert', 'sacking', 'defends']","Mr McHardy, 60, was a cook and handyman to the monks while his wife, 58, had domestic duties included repairing their habits.

Kerala's love affair with alcohol,,[],2010-03-12 05:32:42,"People in the southern state of Kerala are the heaviest drinkers in India, and sales of alcohol are rising fast. The BBC's Soutik Biswas examines why. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in India Jacob Varghese says he began drinking when he was nine years old, sipping on his father's unfinished whisky and brandy in glass tumblers. It's a terrifying story of a descent into alcoholism for this 40-year-old health inspector. At school, he consumed cheap local liquor. He lived in a haze of alcohol through his teens and dropped out of college. He lost a job, cut his wrists twice trying to end his life, landed up in rehabilitation centres and at the age of 32, was reduced to begging on the streets to fund his alcohol habit. 'Lost respect' ""Drinking is a disease in Kerala,"" he says, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""I lost my kin, my respect and all my money chasing alcohol. Everyone encourages you to have it - your friends, the government."" This was before he was dragged to the local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter by friends. This, after 17 years of drinking had reduced him to a mental wreck and a pauper. If you have willpower... booze will never harm you

NL Balakrishnan

Forum For Better Spirit Mr Varghese has been sober for the past eight years, and is now married with children and holds down a job. ""Many of my friends have not been as lucky. So many of my drinking buddies died, and others landed up in mental asylums,"" he says. Kerala is India's tippler country. It has the highest per capita consumption - over eight litres (1.76 gallons) per person a year - in the nation, overtaking traditionally hard-drinking states like Punjab and Haryana. Also, in a strange twist of taste, rum and brandy are the preferred drink in Kerala in a country where whisky outsells every other liquor. Alcohol helps in giving Kerala's economy a good high - shockingly, more than 40% of revenues for its annual budget come from booze. A state-run monopoly sells alcohol. The curiously-named Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) runs 337 liquor shops, open seven days a week. Each shop caters on average to an astonishing 80,000 clients. This fiscal year the KSBC is expected to sell $1bn (£0.6bn) of alcohol in a state of 30 million people, up from $12m when it took over the retail business in 1984. Similarly, revenues from alcohol to the state's exchequer have registered a whopping 100% rise over the past four years. The monopoly is so professionally run that consumers can even send text messages from their phones to a helpline number to record their grievances. ""If we delay opening any of our shops by even five minutes, clients send us text messages saying that they are waiting to buy liquor,"" says KSBC chief N Shankar Reddy. That's not all. There are some 600 privately run bars in the state and more than 5,000 shops selling toddy (palm wine), the local brew. There is also a thriving black market liquor trade. Spirited defence Despite a growing number of people who demand a ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol, there is an equally spirited group of hard-core drinkers who lobby for cheaper and more widely distributed liquor. One of them is well-known actor NL Balakrishnan, a veteran of more than 200 films, who launched a lobby group called Forum for Better Spirit in 1983. The forum's manifesto asks the government to provide liquor through the state-subsided public distribution system, boost toddy production, slash prices for elderly drinkers and supply free alcohol to drinkers over 90. The jolly and convivial Mr Balakrishnan, 67, says his father ""initiated"" him into drinking when he was four. ""We used to go to the cinema together. After the show was over, he would take me to a toddy shop where he would drink. He would give me a few spoons of toddy too. It was an amazing experience,"" he says. He says when his father died at the ripe age of 98 after a ""lifetime of heavy drinking"", he wet his lips with liquor and not holy water, as is the Hindu custom. There are over 5,000 toddy shops in the state (Photo: AS Satheesh) Mr Balakrishnan says that on his average day out with his drinking buddies he downs 22 shots of his favourite brandy - and ""never has any problems"". ""If you have willpower and have enough food to go with your drink, booze will never harm you,"" he says cheerily. But drinking is killing a lot of people and exacting a heavy social cost, say doctors and activists. Rising numbers of divorces in Kerala are linked to alcohol abuse. Johnson J Edayaranmula, who runs the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre, a leading NGO, puts the figure as high as 80%. And the majority of road deaths in the state - nearly 4,000 during 2008-2009 - are due to drink driving, he says. Hospitals and rehab centres are packed with patients suffering from alcohol-related diseases. 'Societal problem' The situation is so grim that, ironically, the KSBC itself is planning to open a hospital specialising in treating alcohol-related problems. It also runs a campaign to combat alcohol abuse. But why do people in Kerala drink so heavily? Jacob Varghese says it is a ""societal problem"" - what he possibly means is that drinking liquor is almost a social rite of passage, taken very seriously. But he elaborates other, perhaps more important, reasons - high unemployment, easy access to alcohol and the fact that drinking has become a ""part of upwardly mobile living"". Most activists believe that ""prohibition"" is not the solution - it just drives buyers and sellers underground. ""The solution possibly lies in introducing drinks with mild alcohol content. And since drinking is also a cultural problem, people need to be made aware of the havoc that alcohol can wreak on their lives,"" says Mr Edayaranmula. Until then alcohol will continue to dominate the lives of many of Kerala's people - and boost its exchequer's finances.

Review 3 September,,[],2004-09-06 15:58:14,"The Terminal

...it's Steven Spielberg's best film in a very long time.

Mark Kermode

In fact, The Terminal is the director's first major work to take place in a non-supernatural American location since Jaws almost 30 years ago.

Spielberg's homecoming happens entirely in JFK airport where an Eastern European called Victor - played by Tom Hanks - lands at the exact moment that a revolution means his nation ceases to exist. Unable either to be granted a visa or flown back home, he lives for months within the airport terminal: finding food, work and love while watched by irritated but powerless immigration officials.

The Terminal - certificate 12A - opened around the country 3 September.

Greasing the wheels,,['George Arney'],2006-07-12 20:34:18,"By George Arney

BBC News, Moscow



Can corruption drive Russians to drink?

Denis is an alcoholic and a drug addict.

But the drugs, at least, are not his fault.

He started drinking at the age of 13. By 16, he was drinking so heavily that - to use his own words - he was ""completely mad, nuts!""

He committed a serious crime - he'd prefer not to say what it was - and then spent a year in prison waiting to be put on trial. After that, being found guilty but ""nuts"", he spent another four years incarcerated inside a psychiatric hospital.

It was in the hospital that Denis became a drug addict.

Psychiatric nurses aren't very well paid anywhere. In Russia they're paid peanuts.

The only thing they have plenty of, is drugs. And pharmaceutical drugs can easily be abused. So to supplement their income, some nurses will hand drugs out to desperate hospital inmates, in exchange for small bribes.

That's how Denis went from drink to drugs. You could say that he was turned into a drug addict by Russia's chronic culture of bribery.

No rules

Bribery and corruption are everywhere in Russia, from top to bottom.

The competition isn't so bad that we have to kill each other yet

Alexander Ossipov

It's not by chance that most big businessmen are former members of the Communist Party elite.

In the first, chaotic years after the Russian bear embraced the free market, those with the best connections seized the state's main assets.

In capitalism's second phase, it's still sensible to stay close to the authorities - which means bribing or ""feeding"" officials regularly. That's the best guarantee that your private enterprise will prosper.

Sipping cappuccino in his Nevsky Prospekt showroom, fabric importer Alexander Ossipov makes no bones about the fact that he pays regular bribes to local officials and service providers - particularly when he's got a new project in hand.

He says the biggest problem is that there are no set rules.

""Sometimes you pay $1000, sometimes $2000 - you don't know for what,"" he says.

""Sometimes you pay today, and tomorrow a new person comes, and says 'forget about yesterday, you pay me and I'll make a new letter.'

""If we don't do it, we don't get the permission. The day you don't pay is a lucky day!""

'The way we live'

But Alexander - Sasha, to his friends - doesn't seem to resent it.

He has a similar attitude to that of the many private car owners who double up as taxi drivers in their spare time.

If you're stopped by the omnipresent traffic police, and if you want an easy life, it's better to pay up.

""This is the way we live,"" says Sasha. ""Although now it is more expensive than before. You have to pay bigger bribes.""

In any case, Sasha is doing very nicely, thank you.

His showroom is full of fine silks imported from Italy, China and India, and he's supplying curtain material for Russia's new rich from St Petersburg to Russia's Far East.

Taxes are low - or easily evaded - and his budget for bribery is well below 10% of his turnover.

He hints that he used to pay protection money for his business. Now he employs a private security firm.

But does he aspire to becoming a curtain oligarch? Would he or his competitors in the fabric industry ever consider hiring a hit man to bump off their business rivals?

Competition

Sasha takes another sip of coffee.

""This curtain fabric market is not so small in Russia. It's a big country. There are a lot of windows that need new curtains, and the market is still growing strongly. The competition isn't so bad that we have to kill each other yet.""

He laughs. I'm relieved. He's joking. I think.

By the way, Denis is laughing these days as well.

He found Alcoholics Anonymous when he was in the psychiatric hospital, and he's been clean for more than a year now. No drink and no drugs.

Good for him. A new life in the new Russia.","['wheels', 'dont', 'way', 'greasing', 'pay', 'russias', 'market', 'sasha', 'private', 'hes', 'drugs', 'russia']","After that, being found guilty but ""nuts"", he spent another four years incarcerated inside a psychiatric hospital.

Jealous wife stabs husband in eyes,,[],2000-07-14 15:01:39,"A man was repeatedly stabbed in the eyes by his wife because she could not bear him looking at other women, a court has heard.

Janet Smith, 39, killed her husband Jack, 52, in a frenzied attack at their Gloucestershire home on 9 January.



It was like a brainstorm when you have a demon inside you

Bristol Crown Court heard on Friday how Smith broke one knife during the assault and went to the kitchen for another to continue her attack.

She denies murdering her husband but has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Jamie Tabor QC, prosecuting, told the court that Smith stabbed her husband in the face 30 to 40 times - some wounds penetrated over three inches into his brain.

Mr Tabor said: ""The pathologist said there were a number of wounds to the face but in particular both eyes had been repeatedly stabbed to reduce them to what he described as irregular pieces of skin."".

He told the court that Smith's intention was ""not to kill but to take the eyes out of her husband in order that he could not look upon other women any more"".

He said Smith told police: ""It was like a brainstorm when you have a demon inside you. You just go like a frenzied animal.""

Obsessively jealous

The court was told that Smith had been obsessively jealous and had a diagnosed personality disorder.

Mr Tabor said the prosecution was convinced she had not set out with the intention of killing her husband.

Smith and her husband were chronic alcoholics who first met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Bristol.

The couple, who lived in Kingswood, near Bristol, had a stormy, drunken relationship characterised by violence, mostly by Smith towards her husband, said Mr Tabor.

At the time of his death Mr Smith had enough alcohol in his body to be more than four times over the drink-drive limit. The defendant was estimated to be more than twice the limit.

The judge, Mr Justice Kennedy, accepted Smith's manslaughter plea.

He also agreed to a request by Roderick Denyer, QC, defending, to adjourn the case while probation service reports were prepared.

Smith has been remanded in custody.","['stabbed', 'eyes', 'smith', 'wife', 'mr', 'stabs', 'wounds', 'jealous', 'women', 'court', 'told', 'tabor', 'husband']","A man was repeatedly stabbed in the eyes by his wife because she could not bear him looking at other women, a court has heard.

High Stakes: Problem gambling,,[],2001-01-26 12:18:18,"In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association first recognised pathological gambling as an impulse control disorder. Since then, the search for a 'cure' has started in earnest.

Previously there had been a number of treatments available to the few gamblers who actually recognised and sought help for their addiction.

Gamblers Anonymous which, like its sister project Alcoholics Anonymous, is a 12 step programme involving individual abstinence reinforced by group discussion and support.

Since the advent of the National Lottery calls to Gamblers Anonymous have increased by 17%.

Counselling

The charity Gamcare have a success rate of 53% with their group counselling sessions.

Due to their encouragement of follow-up sessions, they can claim a 46% success rate six months after the initial counselling course is finished.

In 2000 the amount of counselling delivered was up 112% on the 1999 figure.

Other forms of psycho-therapeutic treatments are also finding some success. They include residential treatment centres such as Gordon House in Beckenham.

In the US there are several centres including Algamus on Santa Ana Island in Florida. Here they offer an intensive therapy and also medium term accommodation for recovering addicts.

Click here to watch recovering gamblers and their families at Algamus talk about their experiences.



Aversion Therapy

Modern medicine is looking into controlling the urge to gamble with a daily tablet. There are several on trial at the moment and initial indicators look promising.

In the past, one of the most controversial treatments was Aversion Therapy which could take several forms.

Electric Shock Therapy involved attaching electrodes to a patient's wrist. They would then be shown images of gambling related activities for example or would be read the horse racing results.

While this was in progress, the doctor would administer electric shocks which aimed to make a subconscious connection in the patient's mind between gambling and discomfort. Experts now feel that this was not a successful form of treatment.

Shock treatments

There was also a treatment that involved a fruit machine designed to give off electric shocks when played.

Another form of Aversion Therapy which was tested involved injecting the patient with a drug that would induce vomiting while they played a fruit machine. A bucket would be placed next to the machine.

Yet another technique was to place the gambler in a room that was completely filled with gambling paraphernalia that would be tailored to their specific interest.

Televisions would show race after race, the walls would be plastered with pictures of horses and the nurse would come round and take their 'bets'. The idea was that they would reach saturation point. Again this enjoyed little success.

Mongolia's drinking epidemic,,['Rupert Wingfield-Hayes'],2003-09-25 13:15:17,"By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes

BBC, Ulan Bator, Mongolia



But today, alcoholism is reaching epidemic proportions, driven by cheap liquor and wrenching social and economic change.

I visited a young man lying on an old iron bedstead in a bare white room inside an Ulan Bator hospital. The man was an alcoholic and this desolate room was his last resort.

Mongolia's appalling level of alcoholism is quite literally a Soviet hangover



Into his right arm an intravenous drip was pumping a mixture of drugs that will, he hopes, help cure him of a disease that is destroying his life and distorting his mind.

""Alcohol makes you feel courageous,"" he said. ""It makes you think you can do anything, take on anybody, even threaten to kill them. I have done these things. I've beaten people, humiliated them. I've even done it to my own family,"" he said.

This young man's story is far from unique.

Mongolia is today in the midst of an epidemic of alcoholism. On the streets of Ulan Bator you do not have to go far to see its effects.

Ulan Bator railway station, even at 10am in the morning, was already crawling with drunks, many of them already so intoxicated they could hardly stand.

On my left I could see a group of what looked to be middle-aged drunks, many of them in a very bad state indeed.

Just across the road there was another group of young men, perhaps in their 20s, and they all seemed to be knocking back what looked like bottles of clear alcohol.

Now the point is, these people were not just isolated bums. More than half of Mongolia's adult population is now reported to be drinking too much.

Economic ills

Mongolia's appalling level of alcoholism is, quite literally, a Soviet hangover.

When the Russians left in the early 1990s they left behind two things - cheap industrial strength liquor and a collapsing economy. It has turned out to be a lethal cocktail.

Tumendemberel once had a good job as a teacher in an Ulan Bator college. But in the early 1990s, when the Russians pulled out, the college slashed its staff and Tumendemberel lost his job.

Unemployment quickly spiralled into depression, and drinking. He ended up on the streets, where he spent the next eight years.

""When the socialist system collapsed it caused lots of social problems, especially unemployment,"" he said.

""Many Mongolians just don't want to face these problems, so they drink to escape them. But far from escaping their problems, alcohol has made them much worse.

""You can see the effects today on society. Crime is getting worse and worse. Muggings are now common on the streets of Ulan Bator. Illness and disease is spreading too. It's all caused by drinking,"" he said.

Tumendemberel finally escaped from alcohol and from his life on the streets. He found salvation at Mongolia's first group of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Each week one group of around 30 former alcoholics comes to a church hall on the edge of Ulan Bator to confront their addictions.

One by one they stand up to tell their story. The process is painful - all the more so in Mongolia with its macho culture.

It is a leap that most of the young men hanging out at the Ulan Bator railway station will never make. Instead they will remain trapped in a vicious circle of poverty, alcoholism and violence.","['epidemic', 'streets', 'far', 'mongolias', 'today', 'ulan', 'bator', 'left', 'young', 'group', 'problems', 'drinking', 'alcoholism']","By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC, Ulan Bator, MongoliaBut today, alcoholism is reaching epidemic proportions, driven by cheap liquor and wrenching social and economic change.

The life of Michael Elphick,,[],2002-09-10 03:06:08,"For many television viewers, the enduring image of Michael Elphick will be as the motorbike-mad private investigator Ken Boon in the hit ITV series.

His trademark was the craggy face and croaky voice, with the appearance of the man-on-the-street - a quality which won the hearts of millions.

The role in EastEnders which he took last year was more controversial, as Harry Slater - the man who raped his niece and made her pregnant.

Chichester-born Elphick's off-screen problems with alcoholism sometimes competed with his acting for press attention.



Even when my life has become uncontrollable, as it has at times, it hasn't affected my work

Michael Elphick

He admitted his battle with drink and in the early 90s sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous.

By 1993, the star said he was drinking again but it was under control.

In 1998, he said: ""I used to be drunk by 9pm every night. Going on the wagon has made me a bit grumpy, but I'm a wiser man for it.""

On another occasion, he said: ""Even when my life has become uncontrollable, as it has at times, it hasn't affected my work.

""I've goofed on lines, but I've never jeopardised anybody else.""

Lucky break

He met his long-term partner, school teacher Julia Alexander, in 1963, but she died six years ago from cancer.

The couple had a daughter, Kate, 25, who was living with Elphick in north-west London until his death aged 55.

Growing up in West Sussex, the actor initially considered joining the navy and helped out in his local boatyard during school holidays.

He seemed to stumble upon acting by chance, as a 15-year-old apprentice electrician at the local theatre.

It gave him a glimpse of life on stage and a new career path.

He began appearing in very minor roles in films as early as 1969 and landed parts in cult movies such as The First Great Train Robbery, Quadrophenia, The Elephant Man and, later, Withnail and I.

His first major television role in 1981 was in the mini series Private Schultz, in which he played the eponymous anti-hero, a lowly Second World War German soldier.

His face soon became a regular feature on British screens, including Auf Wiedersehen Pet and the 1985 mini-series Three Up, Two Down.

A year later, he became a star when Boon was launched and he became known as the ex-fireman turned private-eye, alongside actors David Daker, as Crawford, and rising star Neil Morrissey, who played Rocky.

The show ran for seven series, but Elphick continued his impressive film career, with cameo roles in The Krays and Let Him Have It.

In 1993, the BBC poached him from Central TV for the title role in its new mini-series Harry, in which he played freelance journalist and recovering alcoholic Harry Salter.

His work with the corporation continued with EastEnders, his last major role.","['harry', 'role', 'uncontrollable', 'man', 'life', 'television', 'played', 'times', 'star', 'michael', 'elphick']","For many television viewers, the enduring image of Michael Elphick will be as the motorbike-mad private investigator Ken Boon in the hit ITV series.

Personal cost of liquid lunches,,[],2003-02-20 20:15:30,"Alcoholics try to cover their tracks

British employees are drinking more than ever, at a cost of 15 million working days lost each year, according to the Trade Union Congress.

But the union says few employers had policies in place to deal with the problem.

Tony, 54, who worked for an infrastructure development firm on major projects, told BBC News Online how alcohol took a stranglehold, affecting his work and family life.

Most office workers in the Eighties could be found at the bar during their lunch breaks, he said.

But Tony would drink more than his colleagues.

""They'd have one pint, I'd have two. If they had two pints, I'd have four,"" he said.

Bad calls

Eventually he started going to different pubs to his workmates so they would not see how much he was drinking.

""People have got to realise that alcoholics will do what they think they can get away with,"" he said.

""The fact that work is affected is symptomatic of the whole thing.""

I do wish that less tolerance had been shown to my drinking

Tony

""You don't turn up for things you are supposed to or you turn up for meetings with important clients, half cut,"" he said.

""Or you are in charge of people, they do something slightly silly and you go ape.

""People stop trusting you. In the end I was told never to contact clients without getting someone else's say so.

""They recognised I had skills but they didn't trust me.""

Slow climb

The impact of alcoholism spreads outside the office, often wrecking social and private lives.

""I drank three marriages down the urinal. I went from putting a £20,000 deposit on a boat at the boat show to being practically homeless with mortgage arrears,"" he said.

Tony said friends would make excuses for his behaviour rather than approach him with their concerns for his health.

""I was allowed to get away with things for a long time but gradually people drop you because you say and do stupid things,"" he said.

""Now I am working on my own I'm doing well and gradually regaining trust, but it is taking some time.""

The TUC believes that not enough is understood about the effects of drink on the workplace, and called on the government to fund more research into the problem.

Rock bottom

Tony said alcoholics talk about ""hitting a bottom"" - when drinking is more painful than giving up.

He said he reached his ""bottom"" after a failed suicide attempt and found help and support through Alcoholics Anonymous two years ago.

""An alcoholic must take action to do it himself,"" he said.

""If you force him to do it, it is not going to go down well.""

But he said he any measures to help alcoholics reduce the depths they have to plunge before they decide to get help - such at the threat of the sack after three warnings - would be welcome.

""Alcoholism is a progressive disease. The guys strong drinking cider at the railway station started off by having a pint when they were in the fifth form at school.

""I was drinking from the age of 16 until I was 52. I was probably an alcoholic by the time I was 25,"" he said.","['cost', 'turn', 'working', 'liquid', 'union', 'things', 'help', 'trust', 'told', 'personal', 'work', 'lunches', 'alcoholics', 'drinking']","Alcoholics try to cover their tracksBritish employees are drinking more than ever, at a cost of 15 million working days lost each year, according to the Trade Union Congress.

Raising spirits to combat alcoholism,,['Tracey Logan'],2007-01-29 13:47:49,"By Tracey Logan

Presenter, Health Check Alcoholism special

Meditation has had some positive effect Problem drinkers attending the faith-based Alcoholics Anonymous groups are 30% more likely than others to remain sober for at least two years, according to research published this month. The study, published in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, found their treatment also costs 30% less than conventional cognitive behavioural therapy. According to lead researcher Dr Keith Humphreys, based at Stanford University, this is because it requires fewer hospital visits and admissions. Up to 80% of alcohol dependent patients start drinking again within six months of a hospital detox. So why do AA members have a better chance than average? Dr Humphreys told the BBC's Health Check programme that many AA members point to the spiritual component of their 12-step programme as crucial in fighting the urge to drink. All faiths Its non-doctrinal approach means people of all faiths - or no faith - can benefit. Many people can't buy into AA's basic assumption that you're powerless and have to turn your individual decision making over to a 'higher power'

Professor Alan Marlatt

University of Washington Dr Humphreys said: ""It used to be accepted dogma that there would never be a 12-step group in an Islamic country. ""But today I would bet that it is Brazil and Iran where 12-step groups are growing the fastest."" Last year a group of Iraqi clerics visited Britain, where Professor Sadar Sadiq, the country's National Advisor on Mental Health works as a practicing psychiatrist, to study approaches to alcohol treatment at first hand. ""They attended AA meetings and would like to implement it in Iraq,"" said Professor Sadiq. ""But with the conflict and lack of security our progress is very slow."" Professor Alan Marlatt of the University of Washington's Addictive Behaviours Centre, in Seattle, said other spiritual approaches must be developed to help alcoholics. ""Many people can't buy into AA's basic assumption that you're powerless and have to turn your individual decision making over to a 'higher power'."" Meditation An experiment in the benefits of Vipassana - or mindfulness - meditation at the nearby King County North Rehabilitation Facility offered the chance for Professor Marlatt to measure its effects among alcoholics and drug addicts. The data suggests that there are some really important links between spirituality and health and wellbeing

Professor Kenneth Pargament

Bowling Green State University The ten day programme required the prisoners to meditate silently for up to eleven hours a day. He said: ""We have a technique called urge surfing - you imagine that when the urge comes it is like an ocean wave. ""Starts small, gets bigger. You feel like you're going to be wiped out. But you use your breath as a surf board to ride the wave without giving in to it."" Not only did the meditating prisoners drink and take drugs less after their release, they were also less likely to be depressed or to re-offended than others. Mindfulness meditation is a spiritual approach that requires no religious faith, said Professor Marlatt. So is it just as effective a drug as conventional belief? Pain threshold A painful experiment at Bowling Green State University in Ohio answered that question for psychology professor Kenneth Pargament. He gave two groups of people two competing sets of mantras, one spiritual (ie: ""God is love"") and one secular (""grass is green"") and timed how long each could keep their hands in a bowl of iced water. His findings were published, in 2005, in the Journal of Behavioural Medicine. ""We found that spiritual meditators were able to tolerate the pain of the iced water for twice as long as the secular meditators. "" he told Health Check. ""And we've replicated the study among people with migraine headaches, and people chanting the spiritual mantra experienced a much sharper decline in the number and severity of their headaches."" Similarly, ongoing research at the Oxford Centre for the Science of the Mind suggests religious people suffer less physical pain when focussing on religious images vs non-religious pictures. Lack of definition So what is stopping clinicians taking note? Partly the unscientific lack of definition of ""spirituality"". A recent of 265 books and papers on the subject showed researchers can mean at least 15 different things by it. And even if researchers did agree on what spirituality is, they don't yet know how it mediates its therapeutic effects in the brain. In the past, the idea of a science of spirituality was a contradiction in terms and few would risk their reputations to study it. But that is now changing - thanks in part to the example of recovering alcoholics of AA. At a time of constrained health finances - especially in developing countries where alcoholism is rising fastest - an effective treatment programme that costs 30% less than usual is generating plenty of interest. Professor Pargament said: ""I think there are a number of scientists who have been sceptical but, like good scientists, have been persuaded by the data. ""And the data suggests that there are some really important links between spirituality and health and wellbeing.""

Mel Gibson: Action hero gets serious,,[],2004-02-25 07:53:11,"Mel Gibson directed Jim Caviezel in The Passion of the Christ

But at 48, he was too old to play Jesus in The Passion - so satisfied himself with co-writing, directing, producing and financing it.

After earning his spurs behind the camera with Braveheart, which he directed and produced as well as starred in, he decided he had ""a deep need"" to tell the story of Christ's final hours.

He has wanted to make this film for the last decade, and has said he has tried to make a familiar story less distant.

""The Gospels tell you what basically happened - I want to know what really went down,"" he said last year.

Gibson himself is a conservative Catholic - and has previously told interviewers about his opposition to abortion, birth control and divorce.

Gibson has directed three films during his career

Mel Gibson has avoided publicly criticising his 82-year-old father, saying: ""He never denied the Holocaust - he just said there were fewer than six million.""

Mel was born in New York, the sixth of 11 children, and moved to Australia in 1968 after his father won an injury payout and the TV quiz Jeopardy.

He soon adopted an Australian accent after being teased for being a ""Yank"", and performed at the Australian National Institute of Dramatic Arts.

Alcohol battle

While there, he played Romeo opposite Judy Davis' Juliet, and shared accommodation with Shine star Geoffrey Rush.

Braveheart won five Oscars in 1996

The futuristic film became an unexpected hit, taking $100m around the world, and spawned two sequels.

More acclaimed roles in films like war drama Gallipoli and The Year of Living Dangerously - both directed by Peter Weir - followed before his hugely successful appearance in 1987's cop thriller Lethal Weapon.

Around this time, he also began his battle with alcohol after realising he was drinking four or five beers every morning before work - later attending Alcoholics Anonymous and becoming teetotal.

Lethal Weapon was a global smash, and established Gibson on the Hollywood A-list, with three sequels helping his image and bank balance.

Directing

But he wanted to prove he was more than a Hollywood hunk, and won high critical praise in Hamlet in 1990 before directing his first film, The Man Without a Face, three years later.

He has remained one of Hollywood's biggest box office stars

A string of thriller and action movies like Ransom, The Patriot and Signs along with lighter fare such as What Women Want followed - and proved he is still a major draw at the box office.

And with his fee reputed to have reached $25m (£13m) per film, he has accumulated enough cash to be able to make films like The Passion without having to rely on big studios.

He has also said he prefers directing to acting.

""It's more fun, that's all there is to it,"" he has said.

""It's essentially the same job, which is storytelling, but you have more control over the way you want to tell the story.""","['films', 'directed', 'directing', 'hero', 'film', 'gibson', 'serious', 'passion', 'thriller', 'mel', 'won', 'tell', 'gets', 'wanted', 'action']","Mel Gibson directed Jim Caviezel in The Passion of the ChristBut at 48, he was too old to play Jesus in The Passion - so satisfied himself with co-writing, directing, producing and financing it.

Celebrity clinic targets City drinkers,,['Orla Ryan'],2005-04-07 23:04:16,"By Orla Ryan

BBC News business reporter



Do stressful jobs lead to heavy drinking?

His job involved entertaining clients - lunch started at 1130, flowed into dinner and then a nightclub, five days a week, all expenses paid.

Working in the City did not make him an alcoholic, he says, but for him, and many others like him, the Square Mile is probably a good place to hide.

Now the Priory Group of private psychiatric hospitals, famous for its detoxing celebrities, has decided to target City workers.

Alcohol dependency and abuse are on the rise in the financial services community, the Priory says, as workers overindulge to combat stress, hence its new £60,000 advertising campaign in newspaper business pages.

Warning voices

Ronnie's working life, overlapping so heavily with his drinking life, was one of chaos.

The most difficult people to get sober are those who are used to telling people what to do

Veteran AA volunteer

One Friday - so drunk, he had ""almost-perfect double vision"" - he crashed his car into a monument on Fleet Street.

""I had to decide whether to drive left or right. I decided right and drove into it,"" he says.

""The door opened and someone took the key and said 'people like you ought to be in prison'.""

Ronnie's five-year old son would run away from his dad's ""wobbly eyes"".

His situation got so bad that his own father visited, worried about his son's drinking.

""He kept on and on. I lifted him out of the sofa, I threw him to the ground and I stamped on him until he stopped breathing,"" he said.

Can stress drive City workers to drink?

His father survived the attack and several months later, after Ronnie had lost his job, he started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.

These stories are strangely at odds with the besuited 62-year-old Ronnie, now a director of a high-profile City firm.

These and other stories are ""what I need to remember when I sit here in my clean clothes, in my job where I am respected"", he says.

Ronnie, who regularly attends AA meetings, has not had a drink since November 1980.

Hiding

There is little other than anecdotal evidence to back up the Priory's assertion that alcohol dependency and abuse are on the rise in the City, a rise it links to stress.

Ronnie links his alcoholism to a family history of the disease and says while heavy drinking may be synonymous with City life, ""alcoholism is different"".

Usually run separately from private practices such as the Priory are the weekly meetings held by AA.

There are 26 such meetings within the Square Mile, up from 15 in 1995, growth which it says could reflect greater awareness and growth seen nationwide.

Indeed, AA plays down the link between stressful professions and alcoholism.

One veteran AA volunteer says: ""If someone is alcoholic and working in a stressful situation, if they get a job as a church verger, they are going to take the alcoholism problem with them.""

But he added that ""people are attracted to situations where their drinking can pass for normal"".

Characterised by easy access to drink and acceptance of heavy drinking, the City - and professions such as the media or medicine - may attract alcoholics.

High achievers are also difficult to treat. ""The most difficult people to get sober are those who are used to telling people what to do,"" he says.

A business issue?

Cynics may say that the Priory is targeting professions that can afford its services, but it points out that many of its patients are National Health Service funded and its initial telephone consultation may simply result in a referral to a GP.

For City firms, the welfare of their employees may be key to their own success.

Businesses, the Priory's Dr Neil Brener points out, are only as strong as the people they employ.

Ronnie, who is open with his colleagues from work about his alcoholism, says employers need to take the disease seriously.

""Firms need to acknowledge that alcoholism is an illness and need to deal with it and be as supportive of it as they are with other illnesses,"" he says.","['city', 'job', 'targets', 'clinic', 'need', 'rise', 'priory', 'aa', 'stressful', 'celebrity', 'drinkers', 'drinking', 'alcoholism', 'professions']","Now the Priory Group of private psychiatric hospitals, famous for its detoxing celebrities, has decided to target City workers.

How people beat the demon drink,,['Nick Triggle'],2006-01-06 12:52:48,"By Nick Triggle

BBC News health reporter



There are a variety of treatments available for alcohol misuse

The scale of Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy's condition is unclear, but he is now among the minority of people with booze problems who seek help.

It is estimated that just one in 10 have treatment for their drinking - despite 1m in the UK being dependent on alcohol and five times as many drinking more than is good for them.

For the heavy drinkers, common treatment may involve a consultation with their GP or brief counselling from an alcohol specialist.

But if the condition is more serious - dependency - a whole range of options are available from counselling to drug therapy.

Rehab

There are two stages to the treatment - becoming alcohol free and rehabilitation.

Detox schemes can take place at home with support from NHS community alcohol teams which comprise of GPs, social workers and nurses or in hospital or residential setting.

The idea is that you get the person to admit the problem and then you can start the recovery

Paul Kitching, of AA

Once the individual is off alcohol, the rehabilitation starts. The counselling often takes three months although for some it can last much longer and varies from groups sessions to intensive counselling known as cognitive behavioural therapy.

Clinics such as The Priory may be well known for treating celebrities, but most people live at home while counselling is done.

However, the NHS does pay for people to be treated in a residential setting if they have no support network.

Drug treatments can also be used to either subdue the craving for drink or to induce a feeling of violent sickness if alcohol is consumed in a bid to make people afraid of drinking. Football legend George Best was given the latter.

Self-help groups are also popular - the most famous being Alcoholics Anonymous which has over 3,000 groups in the UK.

Churchill had a fondness for alcohol

AA officer Paul Kitching said: ""The idea is that you get the person to admit the problem and then you can start the recovery.

""We believe that talking to people face-to-face whether in groups or on your own is the best way of dealing with it.""

But whatever help a person receives, it is the individual themselves that has to beat the problem.

Professor Roger Williams, the doctor who treated George Best, said ""It is very important to have support of colleagues, of families, husbands, wives, children - all this matters, the support you get.

Cost

""But at the end of the day it is the person's decision whether they drink or not.""

Two thirds of people who have treatment manage to stay off alcohol afterwards, even if they are prone to the odd relapse.

But with so many people not asking for help, alcohol remains a scourge for the nation.

A study this week revealed the UK had soaring liver disease cirrhosis death rates because of excessive alcohol consumption, while drinking costs the NHS £3bn a year and the economy much more in lost working days and alcohol fuelled crime.

It could work both ways, people could see the publicity and not seek help, or it could increase understanding

Professor Colin Drummond, consultant psychiatrist

A spokeswoman for Alcohol Concern said: ""The problem is that there is still a lot of stigma attached to the issue.

""There is no reason why it should be treated like other problems such as back pain, but it isn't.""

Nor is it clear if a high-profile case such as Mr Kennedy will help in the long term.

Professor Colin Drummond, a consultant psychiatrist who treats people with alcohol problems at St George's Hospital in south London, said: ""It could work both ways, people could see the publicity and not seek help, or it could increase understanding.

""However, I would hope this would highlight that it is not an isolated problem. It is something that the whole society has to face up to.""

After all, Mr Kennedy is not the first politician to be fond of the drink. William Pitt the Younger was said to have habitually drunk several bottles of port a day, while war-time prime minister Winston Churchill was well known for his fondness of brandy and champagne.

And early 20th century Liberal prime minister Herbert Asquith was such a fan of alcohol that the term ""squiffy"" was born.

But despite the pressure being put on the Lib Dem leader, Professor Drummond said there is no reason why he cannot continue at the top of politics.

""If the right support is there and he gets help, there is nothing to preclude him from office.

""People are facing these problems the world over, they can be dealt with.""","['groups', 'drink', 'demon', 'support', 'problem', 'help', 'treated', 'alcohol', 'beat', 'treatment', 'problems', 'drinking', 'counselling']","For the heavy drinkers, common treatment may involve a consultation with their GP or brief counselling from an alcohol specialist.

I don’t remember if I transcribed this incorrectly from the hand written letter I( received. 2. Do not use the egg in the current (or raisin) mixture; or in the dough, itself. Use the egg as a wash over the top of the top layer of rolled dough covering the currents (or raisins) that are on top of the bottom layer of rolled dough. I hope that this makes the above recipe make more sense. David Scott from Johnstown, PA I'm delighted to find this page! My grandmother (born a MacNair in Virginia in 1897) used to give us flat, raisin-filled pastries she called ""bug cakes"". I've looked for them often since, but never found anything like them. I think you've solved the mystery! Mary Llewellyn from Los Angeles, CA, USA My grandma used to call this fly trap cake. She never wrote the recipe down and made it all from memory after she passed away know one knew how to make it. Thank you. You have just made my day. Karen from Canada How exciting to find others who know about fly's cemetery. My mum who grew up in Glasgow used to make it for my sisters and I when we were young. She passed away and the recipe had never been written down. Thank you all! Janet from South Carolina I gew up in the Monterey area of California. My grandmother was from Glasgow, and made us fly cemeteries -- as a 9 year old, I could trade fly cemeteries for almost anything at lunch -- the children's gross factor, I suppose. Anyway, I've had my grandmother's recipe for years, but many of the terms in it meant nothing to me. Thank you. Judith from Oregon These cakes are know as Gurr Cakes in Dublin (possibly from a bastardised version of Norman French ""Guerre"") Denise Courtney from Dublin, Republic of Ireland BEST DAYS AT SCHOOL DINNERS IN GLASGOW WERE THE DAYS OF FLY CEMETERY AND CUSTARD EDGAR from FLORIDA I was delighted to find the receipe for Fly's Graveyard.

Teen drinking 'needs urgent action',,[],2001-07-26 11:19:36,"Smoking among under-16s in Scotland has fallen to its lowest level since records began, according to new figures.

But concerns have been voiced after a study showed a rise in drinking among Scottish teenagers.

Health Minister Susan Deacon said the figures demonstrated that urgent action was needed to tackle alcohol misuse among youngsters.





The figures emerged with the publication of a survey by the National Centre for Social Research into smoking, drinking and drug misuse among young people. The study targeted 12 to 15-year-olds from 1998 to 2000. It showed that the number of regular smokers among that age group had fallen from 12% to 10%. However, the number of youngsters who said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were questioned rose from 19% to 21%. Ms Deacon said: ""It is encouraging to see the fall in smoking. ""This is now the lowest smoking rate recorded for this age group since measurements began in 1982.""



It is disappointing that the fall in smoking levels has not been mirrored in the numbers of young people regularly drinking alcohol

Critics mixed over Minnelli's comeback,,[],2002-04-03 09:15:34,"Critics mixed over Minnelli's comeback

Liza Minnelli has kicked off her European tour at London's Royal Albert Hall. Critics gave her a largely warm response, although one noted that he thought her voice had deteriorated. The Daily Mail

Michael Coveney Liza with a Zee is back with a Zing. Last night she totally confounded the cynics and the critics, among whom I am usually proud to include myself. She entered in that floor-length white mink marriage coat and, casting it aside to reveal her pins and bust in good working order inside a shimmering black negligee-style dress, she roundly declared: ""I'm happy and healthy and ready to rock!"" And boy, was she just. Could this possibly be that sad old frump we saw in a wheelchair, boozed-up and pilled to the eyeballs, overweight, apparently suicidal, over the hill, only a year or so ago? The Guardian

Caroline Sullivan Lashings of... pluckiness, a key element of her repertoire, were in evidence last night. Defying both the thugs who tried to steal her necklace and rumours of nodules on her vocal chords, she twinkled in a black basque and sang blisteringly. Her voice emanates from a body that seems too small to house it, which attached a touching aspect to her performance. But while she inherited the body, voice and diva gene from her mother, there's not so much of the vulnerability. The audience shared her larger-than-life style - don't underestimate the appeal of a gig where the fans dress as if the OK! photographer is waiting in the wings. The Daily Express

She shakes those fake hips and manages a high kick of sorts

She proves she is still capable of creating a one-woman ""cabaret, old chum"", which can blow the roof off the Albert Hall. Watched by an appreciative audience... she shakes those fake hips and manages a high kick of sorts. She strains at some of the new material, and in a couple of numbers, gives the distinct impression she is resting her voice for later. But her signature numbers from Cabaret and New York, New York bring the house down. And then she is belting out the finalé as if her vocal chords had never been away. ""I returned, thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous and you,"" she declares. The Daily Telegraph

David Cheal

The voice is still big but a little husky, and also dramatically reduced in range

The compère, comedian and TV chat show host Graham Norton, had introduced Minnelli thus: ""Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the presence of a legend."" There was little here, however, to bear out this statement. The voice is still big but a little husky, and also dramatically reduced in range. Her version of Crying, for instance, though not helped by an inappropriately jaunty arrangement, fell a long way short of the industry standard that has been set by kd lang. In between songs, meanwhile, she trotted out the kind of showbiz banter that was a staple on TV specials 30 years ago but which now sounds desperately dated.","['voice', 'vocal', 'tv', 'shakes', 'comeback', 'mixed', 'little', 'daily', 'york', 'old', 'critics', 'minnellis', 'reduced']","Critics mixed over Minnelli's comebackLiza Minnelli has kicked off her European tour at London's Royal Albert Hall.

Programmes,,[],2004-09-06 15:55:27,"(Edited highlights of the panel's review taken from the teletext subtitles that are generated live for Newsnight Review.)



GERMAINE GREER:

I thought it was actually two plays. It's interesting that it's called 'Two Step.' The first one is Pinteresque, in the way that the dialogue works and the way they trip each other. Also, out of it emerges this amazing performance of Mona. That's a very interesting character because she is principally a poor woman. Then the next play, Mona has fallen to pieces for some reason that I don't entirely get, and the person I thought was the butt of the first play suddenly comes out on top, so we start being devout believers in the 12 steps.

LAWSON:

It certainly gets rather mysterious. Kwame, there are lots of plays going on here. There is a ghost play, there's a documentary play about Alcoholics Anonymous, a marriage play. Did it all hang together?

KWAME KWEI-ARMAH:

For me, I think that overall it achieved what it wanted to do, which was to create a great character, or two great characters, for Afro-Caribbean actors. Dona Croll was absolutely brilliant, and Derek Griffiths was great. In a way, that's its objectives, which is probably why this play will be done again, even though there are faults with it. It'll probably be done again because there are very few plays where Afro-Caribbean females can show all the muscles that they have. And Dona really flexed her muscles.

LAWSON:

I've read it and seen it and still have no idea what was going on in the second half.

MARK KERMODE:

Structurally it does have problems. In the second half, it reminded me slightly of Charles Burnett 's 'To Sleep With Anger,' but it didn't quite manage to match that tone. I thought Derek Griffiths was absolutely terrifically commanding from the minute he stepped on stage. I thought he commanded the stage. We've said Dona Croll was very very good. I laughed all the way through the first half, I found it very entertaining. The second half bothered me more. I thought it had bitten off more than it could philosophically chew. But I did find it entertaining and I found the jokes snappy and funny. I liked the way it played to the stalls and didn't mind going for a cheap laugh. And I did think that Derek Griffiths really stormed it.

LAWSON:

Kwame, there is an interesting and political question here, which is that this is billed as black theatre in a black theatre season. It's a difficult issue. How do you feel about making a point of this being black theatre?

KWEI-ARMAH:

I think it's a great point. The director - Josette Bushell-Mingo, who is the whole energy behind Push, is like our Lilian Baylis. She is creating these operas and ballets and plays. The whole idea for her is to say, ""Even if there are weaknesses, let us at least acknowledge that we are making a start. History will remember it in these terms."" I have no problem with it being billed as a black play or as a black opera or black ballet. The point is to say we need more, and there will come a time when we won't need to do that.

LAWSON:

It's not specifically about black life in the way that some plays are. Some critics have been surprised by that. That is the struggle - write what you want.

KWEI-ARMAH:

Write what you want - absolutely. These characters are not quintessentially West Indian. There are characters that everybody can access. Our problems are with the structure of the play. The characters are very accessible.

KERMODE:

Can I also stress that it's funny, not just worthy. It's funny.

KWEI-ARMAH:

Yes it is. Rhashan has a wonderful ear for dialogue and wit. The only issue I had was with structure.","['programmes', 'black', 'plays', 'way', 'play', 'thought', 'characters', 'second', 'think', 'great', 'point']","The first one is Pinteresque, in the way that the dialogue works and the way they trip each other.

'Alcoholism is not all about drink',,[],2001-04-20 13:47:05,"""Alcohol isn't the disease Doc - It's the cure!""

At first glance you may think this is a very strange way of categorising the illness of alcoholism, but my classic view of the disease was blown out of the water by the patient who announced this to me recently.

The point he was making is that people who are alcoholics often have a deep seated flaw.

This, for example, can make them unsure of themselves, or craving of attention, and the reason they drink is, well, if you like, the medicine to help them through their troubles.

Someone who is painfully shy might be transformed with a couple of pints inside them, and so they can use this as a temporary medicine to make them feel better.

Their inadequacies and inhibitions go, but of course only temporarily, and unfortunately excess alcohol can have disastrous long term effects on the body.

Dieting

Think! If alcohol was a sure fire way of dieting. I'm sure many people would go for it, despite the risks, even though we all know an effective and safe way to achieve the same thing is to take more exercise and eat less.

The same for an alcoholic - the only sure and safe way is to face their internal demons and problems head on, but alcohol provides a pleasant, albeit potentially fatal, alternative.

In the same way that anorexia nervosa is not primarily about food, alcoholism is not primarily about alcohol.

Being an alcoholic doesn't really relate to how much you drink.

People who drink too much aren't necessarily alcoholics, and those who stop drinking altogether can still be alcoholics - they're just the next drink away from oblivion.

This might also go a long way to understanding why treatments focussing purely on the alcohol side aren't very successful.

Detoxification and residential programmes can be a start, but what is essential is to have a treatment that recognises the underlying problems, and provides long term support when temptation strikes.

My recent patient, who had been through most treatments, told me that the only organisation that really helped him as far as he was concerned was Alcoholics Anonymous.

Members have personal contacts they can turn to, day or night, in times of temptation.

The advantage is that these are people who have gone through it themselves.

Let's face it there's nothing better than experience in this situation.

Now I've started to see alcoholism from this angle the whole disease process makes much more sense to me.

Looking back to the alcoholic patient who died on my last day as a GP many years ago I can see how it was very difficult for him to keep away from his alcoholic medicine.

He had the best of intentions, and knew exactly what harm alcohol could do, but it was very difficult for him to throw away the thing that helped him most - namely alcohol.

What he really needed was to find a long term substitute for the medicine he craved.","['drink', 'alcoholic', 'way', 'patient', 'term', 'medicine', 'sure', 'alcohol', 'long', 'really', 'alcoholics', 'alcoholism']","In the same way that anorexia nervosa is not primarily about food, alcoholism is not primarily about alcohol.

Can an alcoholic have an occasional drink?,,"['Who', 'What', 'Why']",2008-11-10 14:19:31,"WHO, WHAT, WHY?

The Magazine answers...

Kerry Katona: Is it all or nothing for an alcoholic? Kerry Katona says she is an alcoholic, but can control her addiction enough that she can drink. How does this square with the abstinence mantra of many recovery programmes? When pop singer turned reality TV stalwart Kerry Katona went public with her alcoholism at the weekend, she made a rather surprising admission. ""Yes, I still have a drink when I want to, like any other 28-year-old woman."" Yet the popular image of someone who says ""I am an alcoholic"" is that they will also have sworn off booze. Those at Alcoholics Anonymous aim for abstinence one day at a time. ""The basic adage is that the first drink causes the problem,"" says Michael, whose own road to recovery with the AA started 10 years ago. ""It's the first drink that opens the field for a second drink and then a third."" THE ANSWER For those with severe dependence, abstinence is only option Others can change their drinking habits - but this isn't easy, and they may opt for abstinence

Kerry Katona reveals drink battle But there are treatment programmes, including on the NHS, where abstinence is not the only goal. ""To say if you are alcoholic you must never drink again is over-simplified - alcohol dependence is on a continuum,"" says Nick Heather, emeritus professor of alcohol at Northumbria University. But this does not mean those heavily dependent on alcohol - who suffer severe withdrawal symptoms such as the DTs, and drink to ward off these effects - can aim to be moderate drinkers in the future. Will one lead to another and another? ""The evidence clearly shows that those with severe alcohol dependency are far more likely to achieve recovery with abstinence,"" warns Professor Heather, a clinical psychologist. There's no concrete definition of what an alcoholic is, rather experts talk of a sliding scale of alcohol dependency. But for those at the lower end of the scale - an estimated eight million in England alone - it's possible to return to drinking in a responsible manner. ""But it's not easy. It means giving up hard-drinking friends, giving up going to the pub, taking up hobbies they might have put aside long ago."" A major study by the US's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2002 found that of the adults surveyed with alcohol dependency, 35.9% were fully recovered - with roughly equal proportions of abstainers (18.2%) and those who drank moderately (17.7%). WHO, WHAT, WHY? A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines For Michael, a mental obsession with alcohol is part of his condition. ""Just one drink sets off the compulsion. If I had a drink, I'd want the next one. I was always one for sessions, I could never see the point of stopping at just one or two."" Even when he began to attend AA meetings, having lost his family, his job and his home, it took a long time to accept that ""just one"" would do no harm. ""Every addict likes to think they're special - 'I'm slightly different and I'll be OK'. Even with the wreckage around me, I thought that."" For Michael, abstinence has turned out to be the answer. But the perception that this is the only cure deters many from seeking help, says Professor Heather. Below are a selection of your comments. The idea of battling alcoholism was summed up best in The West Wing by Leo McGarry. ""I don't want one drink, I want ten drinks, and I don't understand how others can settle for just one."" Severe alcoholics don't want to have a drink - they want to be drunk. The only way to escape that is to never touch alcohol again.

Kate Jones, Lancaster, UK I'm being treated for alcohol abuse at the moment. I'm not addicted - yet - but for several years I've been drinking up to 100 units a week. My alcohol counsellor and I are aiming to reduce my drinking to safe levels. For me, the problem is not about staying away from pubs, but learning not to drink alone, a tough call when you live on your own and suffer from depression. I find my drinking much easier to manage in company, when I am less likely to drink to blot out my pain. I'm slowly training myself not to buy alcohol to drink at home unless I really, really feel I have ""earned"" a drink. The NHS has excellent alcohol programmes and I wouldn't have managed without their support. My intake is now down to about 30 units a week so I'm seeing real progress. AA is not for me - the Christian ethos underpinning it is not appropriate if your background is in another faith or you are an atheist.

Anon, UK You don't have to be an alcoholic to know that the first drink is the easiest to refuse. Designated drivers take note...

Caroline Brown, Rochester, UK When I was in the Navy, I discovered I had a drink problem - whether I would have been described as an alcoholic is a moot point, but it was definitely a problem. I managed to crack it without seeking external treatment, but it was extraordinarily difficult. When discussing this with a doctor a few years later, he said he thought I probably had a ""non-addictive"" personality, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own. I still enjoy a drink, but I'm now aware of how much I am drinking, and I know when to call a halt to ensure that I have a good time, without going overboard. As regards abstinence or not, I think it is down to the individual, and how they can cope with their own personality and cravings.

Anne Boyce, Halifax, England So Kerry is a wet alcoholic not a dry one. From my experience, a wet alcoholic is someone that has a problem and still drinks, a dry alcoholic is someone that has a problem but abstains because they have to. If Kerry can live with being an alcoholic who still drinks, then let her get on with it. Is her life in chaos? If it is, then she should abstain for the rest of her life. So she must go to a wet meeting also, if she attends AA, that is? There are many types of AA meetings as well, wet and dry, open and closed, it can be quite confusing when you first get involved, the key is, if your life and the lives of others are being destroyed by alcoholism, then abstinence is the only answer for all those concerned.

Brett Sentance, Derby If the alcoholic or problem drinker could see the carnage of his association with alcohol then one begs the question, why return to the insanity or belief that ,this time it will be different. The obvious answer is this, the alcoholic cannot see it. Thus, after a period of abstinence, usually a lot shorter than planned, the alcoholic returns to the drink believing it was the drink that was the original problem. It never occurs to them that they are the problem and believe alcohol is the solution.

Star Trek star loses lawsuit

A lawsuit filed by Star Trek actress Chase Masterton against dating website Matchmaker.com has been rejected by a San Francisco court.

A fake personal profile of Masterton, who plays alien Leeta in the TV series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, was published on the Matchmaker website, including her real home address and phone number.

The federal appeals court said that personal profile information published on the dating service was solely up to the user's discretion and the company is immune from the lawsuit.

""I am shocked, and I'm devastated,"" said Masterson after the ruling.

Bobby Brown wanted by police

Police have been unable to find singer Bobby Brown since they issued an arrest warrant for the R&B artist nearly a month ago in Georgia, USA.

The warrant was issued after Brown failed to keep to the probation conditions of his 1996 drink-driving conviction.

The conditions included 240 hours of community service, six months of twice-weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and an order to submit to random alcohol and drug screenings, said a spokesperson for the DeKalb County sheriff's office.

The violation could result in a jail sentence for Brown when he is found.

Sitcom star Roseanne Barr's return to TV has been put on hold as the actress prepares to undergo surgery.

Production on the series Domestic Goddess was put on hold until further notice after Barr discovered she needed a hysterectomy operation.

The show was due to debut in September but it is not known if the series will now be completed in time.

The development of Domestic Goddess has also been the subject of a documentary-style series now running on ABC, The Real Roseanne Show, which has already completed production.

The cult of the to-do list,,[],2009-03-17 15:18:39,"Is life a struggle? Make a list

Those with too much to do may note down what they need to get done. But one time management system elevates the humble to-do list to cult-like status, says Ewan Spence. They have an almost evangelical dedication to getting what needs to be done out of their heads, into lists and then acting on those lists. But have the 400 people at the Getting Things Done (GTD) summit discovered the secret to organising their life, or do they subscribe to a theory that promises the earth with the occasional get-out clause? THE GTD MANTRA Write down ideas Define the next step If it can be done in less than two minutes, do it now Or delegate it, or defer it If it doesn't need doing right away, file it in a labelled folder Review folders regularly Fans of the time management system have each paid about $2,000 (£1,422) to spend two days in San Francisco with the man who started it all, David Allen, and other proponents of GTD. Mr Allen is regarded as almost messianic by some. But he says his approach is ""little more than common sense"". His 2001 book Getting Things Done in 2001 caused an explosion of admiration and recognition. Hundreds of thousands of people set about reorganising their lives as their prophet recommended. But his system - which can be seen as little more than making good use of a notebook and a pencil - is said to have changed lives. Those who adhere to it claim to be able to organise busy social lives, family commitments, work and outside projects - and still get a good night's sleep. Night sweats ""There is no more waking up in the middle of the night panicking about a project,"" says Mr Allen. ""Thanks to GTD you have it written down in a list, ready to be actioned."" David Allen reinvented the to-do list His words are regarded with a mix of awe and enlightenment by the audience. Speaking to them two things become apparent. Firstly, there is something almost cathartic about writing everything down to clear one's head of that worry. Secondly, capturing every thought you have each day, every day, requires almost superhuman levels of dedication and discipline. Steven and Shannon Pugh say they ""support"" each other in their GTD use. Steven started using GTD in his work with the US Air Force while stationed in Korea, and his wife Shannon followed suit. GTD requires a certain amount of dedication and any lapse can cause the system to break down. When one starts to slip, the other helps them get back on track. With around 300 thoughts a day, you need a system to deal with them, says fellow adherent Buzz Bruggeman, a businessman. ""How do you deal with all these thoughts? All the world cares about is what you deliver."" He says GTD helps him take a thought and either act on it, store it where it can easily be found when needed, or confidently discarded. ""It is common sense, but distilled,"" he says. But what GTD does not do is provide is any extra hours in the day to complete these new tasks. Evangelical approach People take part in the summit to meet and ""support"" each other. But all the talk of helping each other and taking control, mixed with personal epiphanies about how GTD has changed lives, makes it feel rather like an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. So why are people so attracted to the approach? ""It's a sneaky way to get people to do what has always been promoted by a whole lot of self-development, counselling models and personal growth stuff,"" Mr Allen says. ""This little dumb thing can be pretty powerful. As soon as you have an improved condition in your life, there will be a panacea effect and people will want to tell everyone else not using it."" GTD can tell you what to do and when, but it's not a short cut to actually doing what needs to be done. Mr Allen's greatest achievement may not be the re-invention of the to-do list, but to give people confidence to take control of the jumble of tasks they set for themselves. Below is a selection of your comments. Mr Allen's most infamous achievement? The remaking of the noun ""action"" into a verb: ""to be actioned"". It's awful.

Kathy Brenden, Helena, MT, US Writing down lists of what you have to do today certainly doesn't merit yet another three letters acronym. The first thing I was given on my first day of my job as an engineer, was a spiral bound notebook for writing down lists of things to do.

David Routledge, Derby I always have two lists - things that must be done today, and things that need to get done, but not necessarily today. I also have a daily things-I-must-do chart, for ticking off the things I need to do every day, such at taking my medication. If you have memory problems, organisation is essential.

Mallory, Amersham, Bucks Lists of ""things to do"" are very useful when coming up to a deadline which brings together several threads at various points. In the world of engineering it is called Project Planning - in the kitchen it's called a Dinner Party.

ChrisJK, UK I tend to forget stuff when I get stressed and have many metaphorical plates spinning. The more stressed I get the worse my memory gets, then I worry that I'm forgetting things, causing more stress. So getting everything out of my head and into a system is like putting some of the plates on a shelf, and lets me concentrate on just the ones that need to be spinning. There are probably a dozen systems that would work just as well for getting rid of that nagging worry that the thing I'm doing now isn't the most important thing I should be doing. GTD is the one I learnt to work with though, and so far it works for me.

Jools, London Only in America! This man is making a mint out of getting people to write down what they need to do and checking it off when they've done it?

Jacquie, Gechingen/Germany I swear by GTD. It has helped me so much through university.

Yoni Forsyth, London I've never met Mr Allen or read his book but I've managed to cope with reminding myself of tasks and getting things done quite nicely. I have friends who write manic numbers of lists and reminders of what they have to do, and I feel it gets in the way of actually getting on with your life. Having the need for that amount of control over every aspect of your life will only create more panic. Generally, If I have to remember something, I put a reminder on my calendar or on my phone. Otherwise I just get on with what I need to. Taking a minute to think what you need to do means you get to rely on your own brain, which will improve your memory, and will mean that if you lose your list of to-dos, you won't panic.

Heather, Willenhall I've been using GTD for about two years and it does take some discipline but is worth the wait. If the ""next step"" takes more than two minutes then add to to do list and in time break down into smaller chunks.

Sally, Edinburgh, Scotland

Minnelli's tribute at 'triumphant' return,,[],2002-04-03 07:29:17,"Minnelli's tribute at 'triumphant' return

Liza Minnelli started her European tour with a show at London's Royal Hall on Tuesday in which she paid her own emotional tribute to the Queen Mother. The singer, making a comeback after battles with alcoholism and ill health, sang a version of a classic Vera Lynn song because she said it was a favourite of the Queen Mother, who was a ""marvellous woman"". Minnelli, who recently married for the fourth time, received several standing ovations for the show, which included classic hits including Cabaret and New York, New York. But she has also learned that she will face a lawsuit from her 94-year-old stepmother, who is accusing her of abuse of the elderly. 'Lucky' The London concert was the first of five nights at the Royal Albert Hall before Minnelli takes the show around Europe. In it, she sang an a cappella version of Vera Lynn's I'll Be Seeing You. ""I was lucky enough at one point in my life to meet and perform on stage for the Queen Mother,"" she said. ""She was a marvellous woman and I am so terribly sorry for your loss."" The programme notes said the singer and new husband David Gest were planning move to Paris, where ""they will plan to adopt children during the next year"". During the concert, she thanked Gest, who produced the show and was in the front row, plus her fans and Alcoholics Anonymous. She even put on a Cabaret-style basque and bowler hat for one of the songs, proving how far she has come since losing 44.5kg (98lbs) after a series of operations over the last few years. But some fans said some songs appeared to be mimed - although others were clearly not. Former EastEnders actress Martine McCutcheon - who was a bridesmaid at Minnelli's wedding - was among the stars at the show, along with singer Tony Bennett and the Pet Shop Boys, who recorded with Minnelli in the late 1980s. Lawsuit But Minnelli has learned that her stepmother Lee Anderson Minnelli has filed a lawsuit claiming that she was kept ""alone in a dark house"" while Liza and Gest were on their recent honeymoon. Lee Minnelli says the will of her late husband and Liza's father Vincent guaranteed her housing - but that Liza recently sold her house and wanted to remove her ""by whatever means necessary"". Lee Minnelli said in court papers that her stepdaughter sold the Beverly Hills home where she was living, which had the electricity cut off on March, 11 days after Liza's lavish wedding. ""While the defendant is honeymooning all over the world, having fed 850 of her closest friends a 12ft cake, the plaintiff is alone in a cold, dark house, at age 94,"" the lawsuit said. Award Liza was born after a short-lived marriage between Vincent Minnelli and actress Judy Garland. She emerged from the shadow of her mother in 1972 with a show-stopping performance in the hit musical Cabaret, which earned her an Academy Award. Now 56, she has battled back to health, and Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor were among those who saw her marry Gest in New York on 17 March. The pair honeymooned in London, where Minnelli was the victim of an attempted robbery as thieves tried to steal a £10,000 diamond necklace from her while she was in a car.","['gest', 'triumphant', 'mother', 'minnelli', 'house', 'singer', 'tribute', 'liza', 'lawsuit', 'york', 'return', 'lee', 'queen', 'minnellis']","Minnelli's tribute at 'triumphant' returnLiza Minnelli started her European tour with a show at London's Royal Hall on Tuesday in which she paid her own emotional tribute to the Queen Mother.

Supermodel's racism claim 'offensive',,[],2002-02-13 15:44:24,"Supermodel's racism claim 'offensive'

Mirror editor Piers Morgan has attacked as ""offensive and disgusting"" Naomi Campbell's accusation of racism during her privacy case. The 31-year-old supermodel is suing the Mirror for breach of confidence and/or unlawful invasion of privacy after it published a photograph of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting last year. Mr Morgan clashed at the High Court with the supermodel's QC, Andrew Caldecott, over a reference to her in an article by journalist Sue Carroll as being like a ""chocolate soldier"".

When I have a cup of hot chocolate at night am I being racist? This is ridiculous

Piers Morgan,

Mirror Editor The newspaper says this referred to Ms Campbell's being sacked from the charity, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), after wearing mink at a fashion show. It claimed that the phrase meant someone who wilted in the heat and was ineffective. But Ms Campbell, who says she left Peta of her own accord, said it was a deliberately racist remark. Mr Morgan said: ""Her attempt to say Sue Carroll was a racist is incredibly offensive to my newspaper... and I find her attempt to bring the race card into this case is quite disgusting."" 'Chocolate soldier' Mr Caldecott asked if ""the sensitive Mr Morgan of The Mirror"" would call a black woman a chocolate soldier to her face. Mr Morgan: ""Why shouldn't I? I have absolutely no problem in using a perfectly common normal phrase which has not got a racist undertone to it at all. ""Are you saying that the term chocolate is racist? When I have a cup of hot chocolate at night am I being racist? This is ridiculous."" Mr Caldecott persisted: ""Can you understand that a black lady would object to being a chocolate soldier or not?"" Mr Morgan: ""I understand she has tried to use this to get sympathy for herself and brand The Mirror racist."" 'Chocolate fireguard' Ms Carroll was then asked if she was being ""deliberately racist and intentionally insulting"" by using the phrase, and replied: ""Absolutely not.""

If it doesn't offend my family who are mixed-race then it should not affect Miss Campbel

Sue Carroll

Mirror columnist She said chocolate soldier was a commonplace phrase like ""chocolate teapot or fireguard"", and she used it to mean Ms Campbell was not very effective. Ms Carroll added: ""If it doesn't offend my family who are mixed-race then it should not affect Ms Campbell."" Earlier, Mr Morgan said he thought that once ""the balloon had been popped about her drug addiction"", it would be a good idea if Ms Campbell talked about it ""honestly and frankly"". ""Certainly a better idea than having her in the witness box for two days lying."" He added: ""In my experience, almost every celebrity who attends Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous has then talked quite openly, honestly, frankly, and indeed inspiringly, about their experiences."" Ms Campbell left the country on Tuesday evening so was not in court for the third day of her action. The newspaper claims she is not entitled to the same privacy ""as the normal man or woman in the street"", because she uses the media to put forward a commercial image of herself, and talk about intimate areas of her life. MGN argues Ms Campbell has previously deceived the public by boasting to the media that she had avoided illegal drugs when others in the modelling world had succumbed. The case continues.","['claim', 'offensive', 'racism', 'soldier', 'supermodels', 'phrase', 'ms', 'privacy', 'carroll', 'mr', 'chocolate', 'racist', 'campbell', 'morgan']","Supermodel's racism claim 'offensive'Mirror editor Piers Morgan has attacked as ""offensive and disgusting"" Naomi Campbell's accusation of racism during her privacy case.

Combat stress,,[],2010-05-13 11:59:32,"

Alcohol misuse is more common than post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among UK troops. A study in the Lancet suggests that the number of British troops suffering from PTSD has remained relatively low, despite the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the study found those who had returned from front-line duties were at much greater risk of alcohol abuse. The Ministry of Defence, which funded the independent research, says it takes issues of problem drinking very seriously and that counselling and welfare support is available. Former members of the armed forces and their families have been telling the BBC News website about their experience of alcohol misuse. STEVE, EDINBURGH The Lancet based the study on 10,000 personnel I joined the army in 1979 and did two tours of Northern Ireland. I was a 16-year-old lad from Scotland and I quickly got into the hard core drinking culture. I would play hard and drink hard. In the army, there are bars everywhere you go. Alcohol takes the pressure off. The drinking progressed through my army career. I chose a 14-year post in Germany purely because the alcohol was so cheap there. I would go to the bar on a Friday night and not leave until Sunday lunchtime. My wife went into labour with my first child. The doctor said that the birth would take a while and the baby probably wouldn't arrive until the following morning which was New Year's Day. I left my wife at the hospital, drove back to base and drank with the lads all night. In the morning, I drove to the hospital - still drunk - to meet my daughter. I wanted booze more than I wanted to help my wife. When I left the army, I carried on drinking. I spent all our money on booze and I would steal from my wife's purse to pay for vodka. I wanted booze more than I wanted to help my wife

One night I went out drinking and something clicked in my head. I knew I'd had enough and wanted to stop. I derserved better from life and so did my family. I called Alcoholics Anonymous then and there. I've been sober nine years now. I live a completely different life. I have self-respect, my family trusts me and I'm a more effective person. My wife and I celebrate my anniversary of being sober every year. I now work as an AA representative on an army base and I talk to personnel who have done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. My military experience helps me to get through to them. I think the culture is starting to change but slowly. The army seems to be recognising that alcohol is an issue. JAMIE, ESSEX I served in Iraq and Northern Ireland. I joined the army in 2000 and left in 2006. I found the transition to civilian life hard and that's when I suffered with depression. When I was in Iraq, there was no alcohol allowed on the base. We respected the law of the country and all tours to Iraq and Afghanistan are dry. Alcohol problems arise though when soldiers get back from a tour. Although the military offers support and a decompression process, soliders still want to hit the bars. After months of being dry, drinking helps. I really feel for the troops in Afghanistan. They are boys who are expected to grow up so quickly

In Northern Ireland there was a big drinking culture. There were loads of bars on the base and drinking was what we all did. I found Northern Ireland hard. We were getting hit all the time and when you walked down the high street, it looked the same as the one at home: There was a Next, a fish and chip shop and an Adams store. It felt wrong. As a soldier you spend days just waiting for something to happen and that wrecks your nerves after a while. I would be all kitted up, muscles tensed, waiting and waiting. When you leave the army, it's very difficult to snap out of that. For a long time I still felt anxious. I was offered anti-depressents but chose not to take them. I went through counselling which didn't work. What has helped me is finding ways to express how I feel. I feel OK and I have the support of my wife who understands what I have been through. I really feel for the troops in Afghanistan. They are boys who are expected to grow up so quickly. The mental issues start early but only manifest themselves years later. STEVE, NORTHERN IRELAND The military mission in Iraq has lasted six years I served in Northern Ireland and Kosovo. I was discharged because of injury and I served as a private military contractor across the former Soviet Union. I started suffering mental health issues in 1997 which was when I went on my first tour of duty. I would get flashbacks and would lose my temper over stupid things. My worst time was 2005. I had been suffering with mental issues for a while and every time I saw a GP they would prescribe me drugs for depression. I got so frustrated that the tablets weren't working that I started to self medicate with alcohol. I had drank a lot when I was in the services, you do because it's an accepted part of the culture. It's seen as a way of calming down at the end of a day. This time though I was using alcohol to take away the pain. My marriage broke down and my wife and two children moved to England. My mood changes so quickly that I'm scared to go out in case I lose my temper

When you leave the military, you walk out the door and that's it. You become the responsibility of the NHS. My problems are a direct result of serving in the armed forces but I have been offered no specialist treatment or support. It's a case of 'Thanks, you've done your bit, now you're on your own'. I'm off the alcohol now but I'm still not better. I've been seeing a psychologist for two years which helps but I have now accepted that this is how life is and will be. My mood changes so quickly that I'm scared to go out in case I lose my temper. I generally stay in the house. I have a girlfriend and a 15-month-old baby son, they help me enormously. My girlfriend has done more to help me than anyone else. Find someone to talk to, it's the only thing you can do. Drugs and alcohol don't work. Trust me. MICHELL, HOOK, HAMPSHIRE My stepfather joined the army when he left school. He served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands. He met my mum in 1985 and left the army to move in with us. Drinking was all he knew in the army. When he wasn't on duty, he was in the bar with his mates. It was part of the culture and it became a terrible habit which he couldn't kick. He was violent. He beat my brother with a belt. He would shout and throw things around the house

He saw his friend's leg get blown off which I know affected him. That may have been one of the reasons he drank so heavily but I believe the alcohol dependancy came from him living so long in a culture of drink. He was violent. He beat my brother with a belt. He would shout and throw things around the house. My brother asked to go to boarding school when he was 10-years-old. He's 36 now and doesn't talk to our stepfather. I left home as soon as I could and was married at 18. I now have three children and none of them drink. They have all seen what it can do to lives. ANONYMOUS, KENT My husband served in the navy in the fifties and sixties. He had left by the time I met him. We got married in 1987 and at first everything was fine. He behaved oddly sometimes but I put it down to the quirks of marriage. When he drank, he was calmer and more amiable. It helped him to forget what he had been through in the navy

It was three years later when I realised something was wrong. He was emotionally violent and angry. He started to binge drink regularly. The drinking helped his mood. When he drank, he was calmer and more amiable. It helped him to forget what he had been through in the navy. One day though he knew that the drinking had to stop. He became teetotal. I think that's when it got even worse. The drinking had masked his real problems but without this crutch, he became very depressed. He has tried anti-depressants and therapy. Neither really worked. He now manages his own depression. Obviously I help and support him but it's hard. His first marriage broke down because of the stress. We've been married for 22 years and our marriage is strong but we have to work together to deal with how life in the navy affected him.

On the global Taff Trail,,"['Tom Bourton', 'Bbc News Online']",2002-06-20 08:21:45,"



Football, films and festivals have been helping to keep Welsh stars in the world's headlines over the last week.

At a time when a bad word about Beckham seems tantamount to treason, veteran TV presenter John Humphrys has landed himself in hot water with some less-than positive comments about the English football team's World Cup exploits.

Cardiff-born Humphrys, 58, who presents the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, told a gathering of Scottish businessmen the team were a ""bunch of precious t*****s"".

And he added that London would be an unbearable place to live if England won the cup.

He later explained his sentiments to the Welsh Mirror, saying: ""I am first and foremost a rugby fan and, as a Welshman, regard England as the sporting enemy.""

Another Welshman on foreign soil is Anthony Hopkins, who has been profiled in a BBC1 Omnibus interview, speaking candidly about his career, his love life and debt to Alcoholics Anonymous.

In the programme, due to be shown on 3 July, the Los Angeles-based actor also explains that he feels ""American in spirit"" and that the USA is ""a great country to be in"".

As his latest movie, Red Dragon, gears up for release, the Oscar-winner also said he had made ""maybe four good films"" in his life.

Hannibal fans keen for a glimpse of their hero can now visit the teaser site for Red Dragon, and Empiremovies site reports that the trailer will start showing with Tom Cruise's latest thriller Minority Report in the US this weekend.

And the Moviefreak site is posting what it claims are the first six pages of the movie script.

Elsewhere, Hopkins has been talking about sex scenes with Nicole Kidman in upcoming release The Human Stain: ""At 64, I don't have any problems with sex scenes. I just go ahead and do it.""

Fellow Californian Catherine Zeta Jones meanwhile, has expanded her promotional portfolio by signing up with phone firm T-mobile, as well as being the face of Elizabeth Arden.

But rather than salute her busy schedule, the 3am girls at the Mirror are worried that this sudden burst of work may be causing a ""rocky patch"" between her and husband Michael Douglas - although her constant talk of wanting more children seems to refute that rumour.

First steps

While Hopkins and Zeta Jones have well-established acting careers, two other young Welsh stars are just starting out.

Firstly, Charlotte Church has signed up as a wannabe singer in a new romantic comedy set in Cardiff called Family Business.

Charlotte will sing in the film, but not her trademark classical offerings - although she has told the South Wales Echo that, despite a definite shift away from her musical roots, she is not plotting to be the next Britney Spears.

Secondly, former Top of the Pops presenter Josie D'Arby, 27, from Newport, south Wales, is to debut in BBC1's police drama Merseybeat on June 24.

""I was too naive and not equipped to be an actress when I left drama school,"" admits the Rada-trained star, ""I've been able to grow up"".

Finally, although the Super Furry Animals have pulled out of Glastonbury, citing the unavailability of a replacement sound engineer, Welsh fans could be consoled by the Stereophonics.

After weeks of speculation, a fan website has tipped the Cwm three to headline, alongside Coldplay and Rod Stewart.

Let's hope the gig goes as well as One Big Sunday did in Swansea last weekend. With Destiny's Child, Lostprophets, Will Young, Gareth Gates, A and Mis-Teeq all on show, it was certainly an afternoon to remember.

Speaking of concerts, Heat magazine reported that former Step Ian 'H' Watkins, from the Rhondda, had a 'lucky' escape when an unexploded bomb was found at the Power in the Park gig in Southampton hours after he had been on stage. What a relief!","['hopkins', 'south', 'stars', 'wales', 'taff', 'welshman', 'global', 'young', 'zeta', 'site', 'welsh', 'told', 'trail']","Football, films and festivals have been helping to keep Welsh stars in the world's headlines over the last week.

A larger than life culinary star,,[],1999-08-10 15:43:32,"Paterson and colleague Clarissa Dickson Wright were mobbed in the street when they arrived in Sydney last year to promote the third series of Two Fat Ladies.

In the show, they would be seen thundering around the UK in a motorcycle and sidecar, with Paterson's Triumph Thunderbird sporting the registration N88 TFL - for Two Fat Ladies.

The duo built up a following in the US as well - where up to 55% of adults are overweight - and were hailed as a potent weapon in the fight against ""body fascism"" promoted by Hollywood and TV programmes.

Paterson was born in London but spent the first four years of her life in China before her family returned to live in Rye, East Sussex.

She was expelled from boarding school at the age of 15, saying of the nuns at The School of The Assumption at Ramsgate: ""They had to expel me in the end. They said it was the only way to get the rest of the school to settle down.""

Nicknamed 'The Mermaid'

A year later she left school and after two years with her father in Berlin - where he had been posted with the Army - she went on to teach English in Portugal, and lived in Venice and Sicily.

She recalled: ""My whole life was one mistake after another, because I was totally unqualified. I took whatever came along.""





Jennifer Paterson: Worked on Candid Camera, but did not achieve TV fame until 1996

She was taken in by an aunt and uncle in Benghazi, Libya, to feed and care for their children.

""I'd always cooked from the age of four,"" she said. ""With my aunt's family I only had a Baby Belling to cook on.""

In 1952 she came to London and worked on magazines before working behind the scenes for the ITV show Candid Camera, and became a fixture of London's party scene.

Other jobs included being a matron at a girls' boarding school near Reading, and being a cook for the Ugandan legation in London.

Spectator cook

In 1977 she became the cook for the Spectator magazine, where she stayed for 15 years, cooking for the likes of the Prince of Wales, Graham Greene, Alec Guinness and Enoch Powell.

In 1991 she met Clarissa Dickson Wright at a party in Tuscany, but it was television producer Patricia Llewellyn who came up with the idea for Two Fat Ladies some years later when she met Dickson Wright in an Edinburgh cookery bookshop.

Paterson described her new colleague as ""splendid, a barrister, Alcoholics Anonymous, and, of course, fat like me"".

Launched in 1996, millions switched on to watch the ladies ride around Britain on a motorbike, cook lavish meals and mock the tastes of vegetarians and teetotallers.

Poles head home as UK dream fades,,['Rob Broom'],2008-03-06 17:22:46,"By Rob Broomby

BBC News



Many hope to leave the hardship of London's streets behind them

A blue Mercedes minibus in London is packed full of Polish workers poised for a journey across Europe to a new life in a distant land.

But these are not economic migrants - not now anyway.

These passengers are the casualties of mass migration, and they are going home.

More than 800,000 central and eastern Europeans have registered to work in Britain in recent years, and the unofficial figure is probably much higher.

But when temporary work dried-up, many ended up homeless and on the streets - many by now with drug or alcohol problems.

Destination Poznan

A recent survey found 18% of London's rough sleepers are now eastern and central Europeans.

Twice a month a Polish Charity, the Barka Foundation, carries some of the most vulnerable cases from London back to Poland for detoxification, voluntary resettlement and retraining.

The charity's co-founder, Barbara Sadowska, said she was shocked that such a ""massive number"" of Polish people were in such a ""tragic situation in London"".

In Poland the Barka charity runs a series of organic farms, it has connections with a sawmill, and is setting up a pasta factory in the bleak countryside outside Poznan where the London returnees can work and rebuild their lives.

Adam slept rough in London, and spent time in mental institutions

I took the journey home with them, and after picking up temporary papers for those with no documents at the Polish Consulate, we headed out of London guided by a Polish ""sat nav"" system, destination Poznan.

On board were two street drinkers, both recovering from building-site injuries, a homeless heroin-user taking methadone to sustain him on the trip, a former mental patient who has been sleeping rough and a woman too traumatised to tell her story.

Swavek had earned good money as an electrician until his fingers were almost severed by plate glass on a building site.

He has praise for Britain's National Health Service, but that is about all.

Fighting for compensation

He was unable to work for eight months and his family in Poland sent him money to survive after his injury.

He ended up first squatting, and then on the streets, where he turned to alcohol.

In his time, he says, he opened 98 squats in London.

He is still fighting for compensation for his injury.

Britain emerges as a dangerous and hostile place, for these are the victims of a 'cash-in-hand' economy



Piotr was injured when scaffolding collapsed on a building site.

And when casual work dried up, he ended up sleeping rough, knocked out by cheap cider.

At just 35 he would pass for 50, his hands and face are badly scarred, and he has a ruddy, drink-soaked complexion.

Daniel is tall and deceptively jovial, though a little ""spacey"".

He ended up on heroin and crack cocaine - a habit he says he funded by shoplifting and street theft.

He says he was caught 14 times and imprisoned twice, and now says he wants to go home to his family.

Sleeping rough

Then comes Adam who did not want to give his real name. He is talkative and persistent.

The landscape outside Poznan is decaying and bleak

He wears a Paddington Bear hat and thick sunglasses in winter.

There is talk of noble connections, and he carries a silver ring in the shape of a rose for the woman he calls his ""princess"".

He spent time in mental institutions after an altercation in McDonald's.

He too was sleeping rough but his words do not quite match his experience.

""I have had a great time in England,"" he says. ""I'm still alive so I feel marvellous.

""People in mental health institutions are just more fragile,"" he adds.

On the cross channel ferry our two drinkers, denied alcohol on the journey, are noticeably suffering.

Both are sweating and in Piotr's case shaking too.

He spends much of the motorway journey across Europe slumped, glass-eyed, in the corner, barely able to speak.

Warm welcome

Polish sausage is passed round as the French motorway stretches into the night and the minibus devours the kilometres.

I am accused of hogging the heater, but my shoes have melted and I am happy to swap places.

I feel I am young and I can still do a lot of things. I want to go out into the world and do things, and I believe I can do it in London

Ylana

We arrive late next morning at a former state-owned farm.

The landscape is decaying and bleak but there is a warm welcome.

Food in lavish quantities is on offer; the greeting breakfast is a key part of the Barka resettlement strategy.

Over the next few days, I meet numerous ex-London Poles - all had returned with heavy drink problems, and all say they have kicked the booze and started again.

If you take Alcoholics Anonymous, add a twist of Christian charity, set it all in a 1970s workers co-operative on an organic farm, then you have the Barka foundation recipe.

It is personal and engaging, but I cannot help wondering if it is not the flat, monotonous landscape and decaying villages that led many to flee in the first place.

The Barka foundation is driven and idealistic but it cannot compel people to stay.

Within an hour of arrival, Daniel, who is still on methadone, heads off to the nearest city, saying the small village is too ""quiet"".

He prefers to detox with his family, he says in broken English.

""He should deal with his drug problem,"" says the Barka Foundation's Marysia Starzewska. ""But we can't force people,"" she observes.

Adam goes too.

Ready to try again

At a sawmill I meet a hard-working, lively looking woman, who returned swollen-faced from London several months ago.

Ylana drank so heavily that when she first detoxed, she did not recognise anyone she had spent the previous months with.

The greeting breakfast is a key part of the resettlement strategy

Her life is stable now that she has stopped drinking, but I gasp when she tells me she is ready to go back to London to try again.

""I feel I am young and I can still do a lot of things,"" she says. ""I want to go out into the world and do things, and I believe I can do it in London.""

""We are saving their lives,"" says Marysia Starzewska, ""because many people have died on the streets."" But she adds: ""It is shocking that they still want to go to London. I think some of them are really desperate.""

As the new arrivals tour the Barka facilities, people listen opened-mouthed and in shock as their hellish tales of life in London unfold.

They tell of fake job agencies, industrial injuries, shoddy building techniques, soup kitchens, low pay, no pay, exploitation and relentless street drinking.

Britain emerges as a dangerous and hostile place, for these are the victims of a ""cash-in-hand"" economy.

But with pay rates much higher in Britain, the lure is still strong.

Social experiment

Barka's co-founder, Barbara Sadowska, describes the EU expansion which allowed her fellow countrymen to work in Britain as a new Marshall Plan, and a ""great success for Poland"", allowing Poles to accumulate some capital.

But she concedes the mass migration that followed has been a ""big social experiment with big social costs"".

And she is critical that homeless charities in London feed and clothe people without doing enough to tackle their alcohol problems.

The Barka bus offers a lifeline, and she maintains that no-one has returned to Britain after recovering.

That is hard to verify and anecdotally it is disputed.

Within hours Piotr has warmed to the welcome, and committed himself to stopping drinking.

Swavek, who said he was drinking heavily in London, thinks he can handle it alone.

Maybe he can, at least now that the hardship of London's streets are just a distant memory.","['fades', 'poles', 'streets', 'london', 'dream', 'barka', 'journey', 'uk', 'poland', 'things', 'head', 'rough', 'polish', 'mental', 'work']","But when temporary work dried-up, many ended up homeless and on the streets - many by now with drug or alcohol problems.

""I am shocked, and I'm devastated,"" said Masterson after the ruling.

Bobby Brown wanted by police

Police have been unable to find singer Bobby Brown since they issued an arrest warrant for the R&B artist nearly a month ago in Georgia, USA.

The warrant was issued after Brown failed to keep to the probation conditions of his 1996 drink-driving conviction.

The conditions included 240 hours of community service, six months of twice-weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and an order to submit to random alcohol and drug screenings, said a spokesperson for the DeKalb County sheriff's office.

The violation could result in a jail sentence for Brown when he is found.

Roseanne show delayed

Sitcom star Roseanne Barr's return to TV has been put on hold as the actress prepares to undergo surgery.

Production on the series Domestic Goddess was put on hold until further notice after Barr discovered she needed a hysterectomy operation.

The show was due to debut in September but it is not known if the series will now be completed in time.

The development of Domestic Goddess has also been the subject of a documentary-style series now running on ABC, The Real Roseanne Show, which has already completed production.

Blige and Duran Duran added to MTV bill

R&B star Mary J Blige is the latest star added to the line-up of performers at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York.

Coldplay and Christina Aguilera have already been confirmed for the show on 28 August.

It has also been announced that the original line-up of 1980s band Duran Duran are to present one of the awards.

The fivesome, headed by Simon Le Bon, are set to return with a new album this year, following a successful return to the charts during the 1990s.

Actor Conrad pleads innocent to drink driving

US actor Robert Conrad has pleaded innocent to two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol.

The star of the TV series Wild Wild West was arrested following a car crash near his home in Calaveras County, California, in March, which allegedly left another driver injured.

A judge has ordered Mr Conrad, who was also injured in the crash, not to drink alcohol and not drive further than six miles from his home until a preliminary hearing on 18 November.

The driver of the other car, Kevin Burnett has already filed a lawsuit against Mr Conrad, seeking damages and compensation.

Big Brother 4 contestant Jon Tickle has taken a role as a guest TV presenter on Sky One.

A physics graduate, he will conduct experiments on Brainiac, an anarchic new show for Sky One which launches in the autumn.

The show is aimed at making science more fun, with stunts that viewers can pull off at home.

Station controller Sara Ramsden said: ""He took a while deciding whether he wanted to get into telly or not and he has decided this feeds his interests.""

Goodman back in US sitcom

Actor John Goodman is set to star in a new sitcom on US television.

The star, who rocketed to fame as Roseanne's outspoken husband on the long-running comedy series, has been signed to play a new lead role.

But the premise for the new pilot is still being worked on.

If it takes off as a serial, the show will be the 51-year-old's first small screen bow since 2001. ""Roseanne"" earned the actor seven Emmy nods.

Coldplay's Chris Martin has dismissed constant rumours he is to wed Hollywood girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, saying ""we are not getting married in the near future"".

Martin told Virgin Radio's breakfast show that he did not rule out marriage but rumours about possible guests and venues were untrue.

""Everything that is written about Steven Spielberg and Chewbacca is a load of rubbish. Darth Vader is supposed to be giving her away. It is sad because it proves you can't believe anything you read.""

But Martin did say he felt Coldplay needed time out of the spotlight to reinvent themselves after the success of Parachutes because he got the feeling that in the UK ""everyone hates us at the moment"".","['tv', 'series', 'wild', 'roseanne', 'duran', 'warrant', 'lawsuit', 'brown', 'trek', 'return', 'star', 'conrad', 'loses']","A fake personal profile of Masterton, who plays alien Leeta in the TV series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, was published on the Matchmaker website, including her real home address and phone number.

School leaders have had enough,,['Mike Baker'],2006-05-05 23:08:08,"By Mike Baker

BBC News education correspondent



One by one they came forward, bared their souls, choked back the tears, appealed for help, to be rewarded with a metaphorical group hug from fellow sufferers.

No, this was not the Cabinet reshuffle nor the Harrogate branch of Alcoholics Anonymous.

This was the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers.

I have been attending head teachers' conferences for 17 years. I have never seen one quite like this.

No government minister was there to witness it. That is a shame, as something serious is happening amongst school leaders.

Floodgates

The new Education Secretary, Alan Johnson, should ask for reports on the head teachers' conference. He now has a chance to do what his predecessor chose not to attempt: re-build bridges with the association that represents the majority of school leaders.

The head teachers were not opposed to everything, they simply felt they were paying too high a price for school reforms



It opened the floodgates. There were about a dozen head teachers sitting amongst the journalists in the audience.

They almost fell over one another in their eagerness to answer the question. As the union leadership looked on, the press conference was very effectively hijacked by grass-roots head teachers.

It was almost therapy. Each poured out a story of woe. The ingredients were the same: excessive workload, stress, pressure, risks of failure, money worries, the threat of Ofsted, demands from government, difficulties with parents.

Complaints

Interestingly, none of them complained about the pupils. Indeed, despite the horrors they listed, all insisted they loved the job.

It was like a marriage guidance session: they had fallen for teaching years ago but over the years the daily niggles had grown into almost unbearable pressures. They could neither live with, nor without, headship.

This set the tone for the conference. Ofsted's new short, sharp inspection regime was berated for failing to give a full picture of the problems schools had to overcome. League tables were condemned for their negative effect on teaching.

The head teachers were not opposed to everything, they simply felt they were paying too high a price for school reforms.

So the workload reforms were welcomed for reducing the burden on classroom teachers but criticised for adding a further strain to the head teachers' responsibility to find someone to put in front of each class.

Some saw value in the ""extended school"" idea, which will see schools in England opening from 8am until 6pm with extra-curricula activities, but felt too much of the burden and responsibility was falling on one person: the head teacher.

Threat to tables

Their biggest bugbear, though, was the use of school tests for league tables. This is not a new complaint but, this time, the frustrations over everything else pushed them over the edge.

So, the NAHT's general secretary, Mick Brookes, caught the mood of his conference when he said his members were ""sick to the back teeth"" of talking and were now ready for ""action"".

The conference voted to press the government to scrap league tables ""without delay"". The NAHT will now seek to work with the other unions, and with parents, to stop next year's tests being used for league tables.

Mr Brookes talked about the possibility of direct action with head teachers refusing to send in the test results next year.

He also suggested heads might adopt a tactic he had used once, namely inviting parents to send their children into school late on test days. If a sufficient number are late the test results become invalid for league tables.

Apolitical

Was all this just the heady rhetoric of annual conference? Will head teachers emerge from this group therapy session strengthened for the rest of the year?

I think there was more to it than just that. The head teachers' conference is not like its classroom teachers' counterpart, the NUT. The latter tends to be well to the left of its wider membership and, year in year out, makes calls for industrial action that are rarely followed through.

The NAHT conference, by contrast, is less politically involved than many NUT delegates. It does not debate Iraq or trade union laws. It sticks to educational issues.

Unlike the NUT, which called for opposition to every government policy from city academies to trust schools, the NAHT barely discussed topical political issues such as the sponsorship of academies.

So the government would be wrong to dismiss this as political posturing.

These head teachers looked exhausted. They have borne the brunt of introducing enormous change. In smaller primary schools, they usually carry the burden of leadership alone, many of them teaching classes for much of the week.

Recruitment

It is ironic that just as the problems of teacher recruitment are easing in all but a few specialist areas, the problem of head teacher recruitment is growing.

Too many senior teachers and deputy heads have decided the extra stress is not worth the money (and generally speaking the money is not bad).

The cracks began to show when the head teachers left the so-called ""social partnership"" with government. The largest head teachers' association and the largest teachers' union (the NUT) are now both outside this partnership with government.

The NAHT has been amazed at the response of the Department for Education and Skills, claiming it has effectively frozen the union out of all government discussions, refusing even to allow civil servants to attend its annual conference.

This is a big change from just over a year ago when the government highly valued the advice of the former NAHT leader, David Hart (now Sir David). He may have helped keep a lid on the frustrations and anger of many head teachers, believing it was better to assert quiet pressure from the inside.

Now, though, the pressure on government will be expressed more publicly. The question the new Education Secretary, Alan Johnson, needs to ponder is this: is that pressure also about to spill out into schools and will it involve action rather than just words?

The prime minister has often acknowledged that the government needs head teachers to make its reforms work. That is why he has twice addressed NAHT conferences.

But those days of mutual respect are long gone. That is bad news for both sides.

The NAHT saw Ruth Kelly's failure to address their conference as a ""snub"".

Alan Johnson might want to insert the date of next year's conference in his new ministerial diary right now.

We welcome your comments. A selection will be published later.

Campbell takes centre stage,,['Brian Wheeler'],2004-01-31 09:16:25,"

By Brian Wheeler

BBC News Online, in South Shields



Minutes before Alastair Campbell took to the stage on Friday night for the first in a series of one-man shows, news broke that BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan had handed in his resignation.

As a scene-setter for a piece of political theatre this was surely hard to beat.

But it was clear from the outset that the former Downing Street spin doctor was not going to let his epic row with the BBC overshadow his stage debut. Gilligan's name was strictly off-limits.

Campbell: A feisty performance

And that was precisely what the audience got.

The venue - presumably chosen to be as far removed from the Westminster bubble as possible and in the middle of New Labour's North East heartland - was the Customs House, a small South Shields arts centre.

The 420-seat auditorium is more used to playing host to the lower rungs of the show business ladder.

Forthcoming attractions include an evening with Barry Norman and an appearance by The Drifters, although, sadly for the journalists in the audience, not The Spinners.

Campbell gave a typically feisty and combative performance, although with a bit more charm and humour than we are used to seeing from his television appearances.

Gripping a lectern at the side of the compact stage, he treated the audience - including local MP and schools minister David Milliband and local celebrity Brendan Foster - to a canter through his early, boozy years, when he was, he admitted, ""chippy, bolshie and a bit punchy"".

Please don't sit there when I have just been cleared by Lord Hutton and call me a liar

Alastair Campbell

The audience included quite a few of Fleet Street's current crop, although Campbell joked he would only take questions from journalists who had paid for their tickets with their own money.

After a short interval the house lights were switched on and Campbell sat centre stage, fielding questions.

The hacks who had spent the interval gleefully jotting down the titles of the songs playing over the tannoy - including Things Can Only Get Better, and I'm Still Standing - found Campbell one step ahead of them.

""I promise I had no hand in the choice of music,"" he smiled.

BBC 'vital'

Then the impossible happened. The first question from the audience left him lost for words.

Did he think his obsessive nature was due to the fact that he had been an alcoholic. Was he, in fact, a ""dry drunk""?

Campbell took a drink of water.

""I don't know. I am not 100% sure that I was an alcoholic,"" he said.

Booze had contributed to his nervous breakdown, he said, but unlike the questioner he had never enrolled with Alcoholics Anonymous.

After that it was plain sailing. There were several attempts to pin him down on Iraq, which were painstakingly rebutted.

He was also at pains to draw a line under his row with the BBC.

""I think the BBC is a vital part of this country. I have never been anything other than a supporter of its independence and I don't think I want to say anything else,"" he said to loud applause.

A Times journalist asked if he had any comment to make on Andrew Gilligan's resignation.

""I don't. No.""

It was a load of spin

Ruth Leonard,

Student

""Please don't sit there when I have just been cleared by Lord Hutton and call me a liar,"" he told one questioner.

His true venom was reserved for the Daily Mail, as time and again he singled out the paper's editorial stance for criticism.

In fact, his main theme - apart from emphasising his loyalty to the Labour party and his ongoing friendship with Tony Blair - was the cynicism of the British press.

Careful words

There was, in truth, plenty of ammunition for the cynical British press to get their teeth into.

Now that Nelson Mandela had retired, he said, Tony Blair was probably the most popular and respected politician in the world.

There was clearly a tension between Campbell's efforts to be candid with the audience and his desire to avoid handing the press a free headline. He chose his words with great care throughout.

The biggest gaffe of the night - and the only time he threatened to go off message - was when he said George W Bush was ""a lot cleverer than he looks"".

He quickly back-pedalled, deftly turning it into a joke. ""I didn't say that last sentence. That was unsaid.""

In the theatre's bar afterwards, reaction was mixed.

""I think he came across as incredibly genuine and committed. I was surprised about how positive he was about the BBC,"" said Andrew Dixon, 45, who works in the arts.

Others were less convinced.

""I think it was just a performance. It didn't change my opinion of him at all. It was a load of spin,"" said 17-year-old A-level student Ruth Leonard.","['takes', 'centre', 'dont', 'took', 'used', 'andrew', 'fact', 'campbell', 'audience', 'bbc', 'stage', 'think']","By Brian WheelerBBC News Online, in South ShieldsMinutes before Alastair Campbell took to the stage on Friday night for the first in a series of one-man shows, news broke that BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan had handed in his resignation.

Faces of the week,,[],2003-08-29 17:08:42,"

Our regular look at some of the faces which have made the news this week. Above are Michael Barrymore (main picture), with Kelly Holmes, Alastair Campbell, Sir Cliff Richard and Cameron Diaz.(clockwise from top left). Click for more MICHAEL BARRYMORE

There were always two Michael Barrymores. On stage or television, in total command. Without the performer's mask, an insecure and vulnerable man, his life spinning out of control and leaving emotional casualties in the wake of its reckless flight. He was one of the UK's top light entertainment stars, until 30 March 2001, when the body of a man he scarcely knew was found in the swimming pool of Barrymore's home in Essex. Although an inquest did not implicate the presenter in the death of 31-year-old Stuart Lubbock, television bosses sacked Barrymore after an open verdict. And while Barrymore, 51, is to begin a one-man show in London's West End next month, he says the public will decide whether he returns to TV screens. The entertainer says he has now been teetotal and drug free for two and a half years, although he would be ""in danger"" if he stopped attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. The troubled funnyman Barrymore is confronting a reality he has avoided most of his life. He discovered the value of laughter as a boy in Bermondsey in south London. One night, when their drinking, gambling father keeled over, young Michael and his brother took money from his pocket and went to the cinema. ""I was eight or nine and I'd never seen a film, and it was a Norman Wisdom film and I laughed for two hours and forgot about the problems at home."" It seems his own, anarchic humour couldn't be suppressed. When he travelled around Europe, playing keyboards with a rock band, he would stand on his head, in an impersonation of Alan Whicker Down Under. When he worked in Selfridge's toy department, they took a dim view of Barrymore setting up a toy picket line during the firefighters' strike. Two events in the 1970s paved the way to success. He won the television talent show, New Faces, and married Cheryl, a former dancer who became his manager. Barrymore's career went from strength to strength. Viewers loved his old-fashioned, music hall routine on Strike it Lucky and My Kind of Music. His zany antics were reminiscent of Danny Kaye, while he had a Bruce Forsyth-like ability to send up his guests without quite crossing into callousness. ""Unlike other comedians who mock the public, Barrymore convinces you he likes them,"" says another entertainer, Graham Norton. ""And we like him for it."" But his manic style needed a stable base. In 1991, he was hit hard by the death of Cheryl's father, who had adopted him as a surrogate son. ""I felt abandoned. I was angry that he'd died and left me."" Four years later, his coming-out as gay spelt the end of his marriage. And when another stabilising influence left him - his partner, Shaun Davis - Barrymore's life spiralled out of control. Fame for Barrymore is the sharpest of two-edged swords. ""Give me an audience and I could do anything,"" he says. ""Take me away from that and I couldn't cope."" The burden of being a 24/7 celebrity has all but broken Barrymore before, but he says he has learned through AA that ""when you face your fears, you can deal with them."" A return to the glare of TV might prove the sternest of tests for that belief. KELLY HOLMES

Britain's Kelly Holmes didn't give a hoot about the suggestion that her friend Maria Mutola had helped her to an 800 metres silver medal at the world athletics championships in Paris. A Russian rival complained that they conspired to deprive her of second place. But Holmes was adamant: ""I could have done it without Maria. But when the best in the world has that much belief in you, it gives you confidence."" Full story ALASTAIR CAMPBELL

Alastair Campbell, regarded by many as the real deputy PM, announced his departure from Number 10, leaving Tony Blair a lonely man - said some observers. Others believed his timing was a master stroke by the spin supremo, designed to take Hutton heat off his boss. What next? Campbell has said his diaries must wait, which might leave time to pursue another dream and cause sleepless nights for the manager of Burnley football club - that's the job Campbell really covets.

Diaz is set to pick up £13m for her next film, a remake of Fun With Dick And Jane, while her co-star Jim Carrey will earn double that. Full story SIR CLIFF RICHARD

... and now for some good news,,['Tom Geoghegan'],2005-03-08 14:20:02,"By Tom Geoghegan

BBC News Magazine



Drink driving, ill discipline and bad language. Football's image is at a low ebb after a series of damaging stories, so where are the good role models?

Even in the context of a year of negative headlines, it's been a bad week for footballers.

First Jermaine Pennant was jailed for three months after drink-driving while banned.

Then Martin Ward, deputy leader of the Secondary Heads Association, suggested that swearing, cheating and violence on the pitch was corrupting children watching the games on television.

Yet there are some positive stories to be heard.

All players are contractually obliged to spend a certain number of hours doing community work, says the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA).

But some players - even those with less than angelic reputations on the pitch - go beyond the call of duty.

THE CHRISTIAN

Gavin Peacock, a former player at QPR and Chelsea, is now a BBC football pundit. He is still involved in Christians in Sport, which is a charity providing pastoral care and Biblical instruction to professional sports players.

He became a Christian in his teens and later hosted prayer meetings about every five weeks at his London home for other footballers.

I would like to think I played the game in a fair way and if that's my faith running through me, then great

Gavin Peacock

Today, Peacock's role as host is filled by Newcastle's Shola Ameobi but he still visits youth groups to talk about his faith.

Being a Christian means admitting you need God in your life, he says, regardless of your status in sport. And he did not leave his Christian values behind when he walked on to the pitch.

""I would like to think I played the game in a fair way and if that's my faith running through me, then great,"" he says.

""There's been a lot said recently about players' behaviour and Wayne Rooney in particular. I think that's unacceptable behaviour.

""It's about standards and if you're a Christian it's not any easier but at least you have those standards in front of you. Without a doubt, my faith is a force for good in that respect.""

THE CHAMPION OF AFRICANS

Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira helped set up Diambars, which is an education project for promising footballers in his native Senegal, with some other French players. Diambars means ""warriors"" in Senegal's Wolof language.

Vieira defies his fearsome reputation as a player

It is a football academy but with 70% of the time spent learning other subjects, with a pledge to support all its pupils, even if they leave football.

Scouts tour the country looking for promising players and although it only takes 48 lucky children each year, it aims to inspire hundreds more about the importance of going to school.

""The message we are giving out across the nation is you have to go school - basically education goes hand in hand with football - no education; no football,"" says Vieira, who hopes the Saly institute is the first of many.

THE FUNDRAISER

Tranmere's Jason McAteer would be the first to admit he was no angel on the pitch. The former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland player is considered one of football's mischief-makers and it's a role he has sometimes revelled in.

But a tsunami aid football match on 27 March, expected to raise £1m, is all down to his goodwill.

Watching the tragic events unfolding after Christmas, he remembered the warm welcome he got while touring Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand with Liverpool in 1996.

And filled with horror as the death toll mounted, he decided to ring friends like Jamie Redknapp, Robbie Fowler, John Barnes, Kevin Keegan and Kenny Dalglish. Soon he had two star-studded sides and a venue, Anfield.

""Charity is a very powerful word,"" he told reporters. ""It makes people stand up and think. It drags the best out of them.""

THE AIDS CAMPAIGNER

A visit to Zimbabwe by Andy Cole in 1999 had a profound effect on the striker.

I left Africa knowing I just had to do something

Andrew Cole

So he set up the Andy Cole Children's Foundation to help youngsters in southern Africa. It has since raised hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Cole, now at Fulham, is a very private person but in a rare media interview in 2002, he said: ""I left Africa knowing I just had to do something.

""They were children, some little older than toddlers, whose lives had been broken down to such an extent that they were forced into sleeping in drains and gutters and to rummaging in bins for scraps of food.""

THE REFORMED ALCOHOLIC

Former England captain Tony Adams set up the Sporting Chance clinic in 2000, to provide support, counselling and treatment to sportsmen and women suffering from addictions.

Its most recent high-profile client is Adrian Mutu, the ex-Chelsea player who admitted cocaine abuse. Others include Paul McGrath and Paul Merson.

Adams successfully overcame his own alcohol addiction after a descent into self-destruction which culminated in a jail sentence for a drink-driving offence. It's a journey the former Arsenal player relives as a lesson to Premiership stars he speaks to while touring clubs with the PFA.

The Hampshire clinic offers residential or day care and its clients' addictions can range from alcohol and drug abuse to gambling and eating disorders.

It uses the Twelve Steps programme of recovery used by Alcoholics Anonymous, but with crucial differences such as football training available on site.","['players', 'player', 'role', 'pitch', 'football', 'christian', 'set', 'faith', 'good', 'think', 'thats']","Football's image is at a low ebb after a series of damaging stories, so where are the good role models?

Information rich information poor,,[],1999-10-09 00:00:00,"The hype for everything online obscures the reality about how technology is changing life at the end of the 20th century.

From Manhattan and Madrid, the Internet has fundamentally changed work, recreation - even love. But in Malawi and Mozambique, life remains very much the same.

More than 80% of people in the world have never heard a dial tone, let alone sent an email or downloaded information from the World Wide Web.

""Think how powerful the Internet is. Then remind yourself that fewer than 2% of people are actually connected,"" said Larry Irving, former US assistant secretary of commerce. The power of the Web increases exponentially with every person who goes online. Imagine what we're missing.""

Facts first

First the figures. The statistics on the basic building block of connectedness - that is, phone lines - are stark.

According to the latest UN Human Development Report, industrialised countries, with only 15% of the world's population, are home to 88% of all Internet users. Less than 1% of people in South Asia are online even though it is home to one-fifth of the world's population.

The situation is even worse in Africa. With 739 million people, there are only 14 million phone lines. That's fewer than in Manhattan or Tokyo. Eighty percent of those lines are in only six countries. There are only 1 million Internet users on the entire continent compared with 10.5 million in the UK.

Even if telecommunications systems were in place, most of the world's poor would still be excluded from the information revolution because of illiteracy and a lack of basic computer skills.

In Benin, for example, more than 60% of the population is illiterate. The other 40% are similarly out of luck. Four-fifths of Websites are in English, a language understood by only one in 10 people on the planet.

Barriers

The lack of resources in poor communities can't explain the technology gap alone.

In the developing world, there is still resistance to the idea that technology is a quick-fix.

Take the African Virtual University. The World Bank-sponsored programme has broadcast over 2000 hours of instruction to over 9000 students in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The initiative has allowed AVU students to take courses given by professors from world-renowned educational institutions in Africa, North America, and Europe.

That does not impress Ethiopian Meghistab Haile: ""With that money just imagine how many lecturers you could have. If the World Bank is really wanting to help African universities then the first step would be to encourage and support the Africans to return back. In the end it is only the Africans who could solve their problems.""

Others complain that high-tech education - available only to a select elite - is not worth it when so many places on the continent are still without electricity and running water.

""Our priorities are hygiene, sanitation, safe drinking water,"" said Supatra Koirala who works at a private nursing home in Kathmandu. ""How is having access to the Internet going to change that?""

How to close the gap

As the famous Alcoholics Anonymous saying goes: Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery. International organisations, governments and private institutions are just starting to do this.

When I was first talking about the Internet in the developing world in 1992, I was called a 'technofascist' and a 'cybercolonist',"" said Larry Irving. ""Now I don't get those comments, just questions about how can we get this - and fast.""

Magda Escobar, Executive Director of Plugged In, a non-profit working to bring technology resources to poor communities in California, agrees.

The convergence of a lot of different interests has put this on the agenda,"" she said. ""The general public is interested in having access to the tech revolution, businesses want to expand their markets, schools are interested in trying to change the way kids are taught. Everyone's awareness is coming together at the same time.

Experts like Mr Irving estimate that the Internet will be virtually global in five to seven years. But for that to happen infrastructure must be put in place, which means a lot of money - and fast.

The Net may be the wave of the future but age-old problems still apply.","['lines', 'million', 'internet', 'online', 'technology', 'irving', 'rich', 'africa', 'information', 'worlds', 'poor', 'world']","More than 80% of people in the world have never heard a dial tone, let alone sent an email or downloaded information from the World Wide Web.

Martin Sheen: 'President' under fire,,['Bob Chaundy'],2003-03-07 18:19:14,"By Bob Chaundy

BBC News profiles unit



Ever since President George W Bush asked the American people ""Are you with us or against us?"" in the war against terrorism - to which he has linked Iraq - the political atmosphere in the United States has been highly charged.

""We are telling the world that we are patriotic Americans but we do not support going to war with Iraq,"" Sheen told an audience recently.

His Hollywood union, the Screen Actors Guild, has expressed concern that certain of its members holding ""unacceptable"" views might be punished by losing their right to work.

It recalls, it says, the days of the McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s when so-called Communists were blacklisted.

Sheen with co-star Allison Janney at the Emmys

It's ironic, too, that the president of the guild at that time was none other than Ronald Reagan who, as we know, went on to attain the office Martin Sheen is portraying in The West Wing.

""Given that several musicians at the recent Grammy Awards reported receiving requests NOT to talk about the war during the telecast, I think the Screen Actors Guild is justified in being concerned,"" Tom Cole, arts editor of US National Public Radio, told BBC News Online.

""McCarthy is riding again,"" declares Glenda Jackson, Oscar-winning actress turned Labour Party member of parliament.

She told BBC News Online: ""Television in America is not just about programmes, it's about the products they sell. TV executives will be pressured by the advertisers given that the majority opinion in America is pro-war.""

Martin Sheen's President Bartlet is far removed from George W Bush. Bartlet is liberal, idealistic, intellectual and charismatic.

Being arrested at a United Farmworkers protest in 1987

Yet the man who plays Bartlet is more radical still, and, over the years, has become one of the most prominent campaigners for social justice and peace.

Martin Sheen has been arrested more than 70 times at protests, on a range of issues from the rights of workers and the homeless, to the environment and defence.

I give Martin Sheen my fullest support

Glenda Jackson

He was born Ramon Estevez in 1940, in Ohio, the seventh of 10 children of a Spanish immigrant father and an Irish mother.

He so wanted to be an actor that he deliberately failed his entrance exam to the University of Dayton, so that he could attend acting school in New York.

He changed his name to Martin Sheen to avoid being typecast in ethnic roles. All his four children were to become actors. Emilio, Ramon and Estelle kept the Estevez name; only Charlie retained his father's stage alias.

How did Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness influence the 1979 war movie Apocalypse Now?

In Pictures



His performance led to Francis Ford Coppola handing him the part of Captain Willard in the Vietnam epic, Apocalypse Now. It was a near-disaster.

The shooting took nearly seven months in a hostile Philippines swamp. Sheen was drinking heavily, and, eventually, had a heart attack. He was 36.

Faith restored

Soon afterwards, Martin Sheen signed up to Alcoholics Anonymous, and channelled his energies into political activism.

We're addicted to war

Martin Sheen

He credits a meeting with Mother Teresa in Rome, in 1991, as the catalyst for his re-adoption of the Catholic faith.

""I'm not interested in religion per se,"" he said, ""I'm interested in spirituality, truth and in my humanity, and I find that in the Christian community.""

Martin Sheen's popularity as an actor, together with his genuine commitment to social causes, makes him the ideal celebrity to raise the anti-war profile.

Martin Sheen returned to the Catholic fold

""To a little old lady living in a small mid-western town, who's uncomfortable with the prospect of war but who feels that she's the only one with those views, to hear someone like Martin Sheen is reaffirming,"" says Glenda Jackson. ""It makes her feel less vulnerable.""

Unlike Jackson, Martin Sheen is not interested in party politics. ""I certainly don't have the kind of intelligence or the make-up to be a real president"", he said recently.

While President Bartlet often agonises over the difficult decisions involving the fate of America, Martin Sheen has fewer doubts as to where his personal convictions lie.","['president', 'jackson', 'interested', 'sheen', 'bartlet', 'martin', 'war', 'america', 'told', 'guild']","Sheen with co-star Allison Janney at the EmmysIt's ironic, too, that the president of the guild at that time was none other than Ronald Reagan who, as we know, went on to attain the office Martin Sheen is portraying in The West Wing.

In two minds about therapy,,['Tom Geoghegan'],2005-01-07 11:30:49,"By Tom Geoghegan

BBC News Magazine

A new play which suggests therapy may increase dependency has reignited the debate about whether it makes people more needy. As more Britons than ever before seek counselling, many are in two minds about talking over their feelings. Forget the famous British stiff upper lip - more people are opening up to talk through their problems with a professional. The number of qualified counsellors has tripled in 10 years to keep up with rising demand. And January is the peak period for sessions as people reassess their lifestyles, according to charity Drugscope. A society becoming more mobile, detached, stressed and divorce-ridden is blamed for the rush to the couch, underlined and encouraged by celebrities such as Robbie Williams speaking openly about their therapy. Although widely held as a cause for celebration that the British are no longer bottling up their problems, there is scepticism in some quarters. A 'separation' develops with normal people because drinking and drugs makes them dangerous

Alice Kahrmann Therapy can become an addiction in itself, says Alice Kahrmann, 23, who has written a loosely biographical play called Powerless, which opens on Friday in London. It tells the story of two people who try to break free from the rigours of treatment. Ms Kahrmann had an eating disorder for five years and went on a 12-Step treatment programme, an approach popular all over the world with groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. But she says she merely substituted one addiction for another. ""The way the programme works isn't about empowering the individual but becoming dependent on the group,"" she says. ""The mentality is that once an addict, always an addict and a 'separation' develops with normal people because drinking and drugs makes them dangerous. You're told that once you will leave, you will relapse."" Fear on leaving She says the system worked really well for people with drug and alcohol dependency but not for her, because talking about food, weight and image incessantly meant she was living the identity of someone with an eating disorder. WHO TO TURN TO? Psychiatrist: A qualified medical doctor who then specializes in the broad field of mental health, can prescribe medicine, commonly deals with depression, schizophrenia Psychologist: Clinical and counselling psychologists offer individual therapy for conditions such as eating disorders, substance abuse, phobias and low self-esteem Counsellor/Psychotherapist: Umbrella term for practitioners of 'the talking therapies' including marriage, family and sex therapists. Accreditation requires rigorous training and supervision Psychoanalyst: originally inspired by the works of Freud and Jung, deals with 'making the unconscious conscious' eg. neurosis Life coach: Helps people set and achieve personal goals

Source: BACP Depression was the root cause of the problem, she says, and she left the programme after six months to seek help - a move which initially struck her with fear. But she tried alternative treatment called neurofeedback and has felt better since. An Alcoholics Anonymous spokeswoman said the 12-Step Fellowship was designed 70 years ago for people with drink problems and had been successful in ""repairing the damage of the past"" for thousands of people. But Ms Kahrmann's experience is not uncommon for people undergoing counselling or psychotherapy, claims sociologist Frank Furedi. ""Therapy does increase dependency,"" he says. ""It distracts people from dealing with their problems and makes them estranged from their friends and lovers."" Counsellors are shaping people's lives, he argues, because ""you find you are doing things according to a script written by someone else"". ""A lot of people say it works for them but what they mean is they are being listened to and taken seriously by someone. Their problems remain and they go from one therapy to another, on a lifelong quest."" 'Diana effect' He fears the rise in the number of counsellors - and more recently ""life coaches""- is creating a needy society encouraged by an Oprah Winfrey culture. Nonsense, that's just nostalgia for the repressed 1950s, says Phillip Hodson of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy, who is delighted more and more people are talking about their feelings. ""Britain's stiff upper lip has wobbled, if not on occasion broken down,"" he says, since the public grief of Princess Diana's death. Even butch men are using the couch Counselling has spread because organisations have found it to be an extremely successful and cost-effective solution, he says. It can reduce rates of sickness and absence by half. ""Life has changed since we became a rich country. It isn't about a struggle to survive but we may well be troubled by the meaning of life and where it's going. These are marginal areas of relative pain. ""So in the absence of an overwhelming theology or a paternal family, we look for therapy to help us in a supportive and questioning role. It doesn't just deal with problems, but existential philosophy as well - the meaning of life."" He says 12 Steps does not constitute proper therapy, - although it has ""saved the lives"" of countless drug and alcohol addicts - because it tackles the effect, not the root cause. ""Therapy is being able to tell a story of your own life and the feelings you've been hiding, so you can address them, put them away and free up your behaviour."" No jargon, please He concedes there needs to be more regulation of practitioners and is critical of the notion professionals can take away pain or heal the soul. But he scotches the theory that counsellors encourage dependence. ""The goal of a therapist is to get rid of his clients."" Good therapy makes the client more ""autonomous and self-determined"", says the UK Council of Psychotherapists. ""The individual should be able to find their way around the various types of therapy available supported by simple 'jargon-free' signposting,"" says a spokeswoman. ""The therapist should be supportive, effective, responsive to their needs, safe to practice and accountable."" Powerless runs at Barons Court Theatre in London until 23 January Here are some of your comments. Thanks for contributing to the debate. Whether or not a person becomes addicted to counselling may depend on the skills and training of the counsellor. I'm currently in therapy after the dramatic break-up of my marriage. Therapy has helped me regain my life and I had to dig deep into my inner strength. My therapist has helped me to explore myself and to grow stronger. I'm not dependant on my therapist but rather I see it as a fast track route to healing.

Mohammed, United Arab Emirates Having spent some time in a 12-step programme myself, I can say that I did become co-dependant on the group. To question the philosophy was frowned upon. Fear of relapse was used by the group collective to prevent people from leaving. I have no doubt that such groups have a lot in common with other cults, having experienced being in one as a child. I managed to extracate myself from the 12-step fellowship, got myself into therapy and far from being dependent, I have for now finished therapy. I have dealt with the causes of my problems and not just the symptoms. If I need therapy again, it is there. I don't carry the shame anymore I used to. Indeed my life is better than it has ever been. Therapy has been the best thing I have ever done. I now feel at peace with myself and am enjoying my life.

Paul, United Kingdom I have been a member of AA for 5 years and follow the 12-Step programme. To start with, it was just about learning to abstain from the alcohol addiction that was killing me but, in the longer term, following the programme has enabled me to have a whole new outlook on life, to deal with my underlying depression and to be happy with myself and my sobriety. My own experience is that it is not 'shame-based' at all but focuses very much on personal change and growth (as well as clearing away old damage to myself and others).

Laurence C, UK Life coaching doesn't deserve to be in this group because unlike therapies, which presume you are broken and need to be fixed - or more normally to talk at expensive length about your problems - coaching moves people on by reinstating their belief that they can cope, and motivating them to do it. I'm not a coach but have benefited enough from coaching to have an opinion on this, it's turned my life around.

Pat, London UK I worry that some counsellors hold on to clients as they pay their wages. Also by going over painful events over and over again some people fail to move on because they are held in that painful time. I think therapy has a place (I hope so as I am a counsellor) but would like to see different regulation perhaps under the NHS umbrella so that clients are not meal tickets for the unscrupulous. Regulation by other counsellors is not ideal, in my opinion, as they have a vested interest in increasing the workload

Susan, UK I have spent 13 years trying to 'get myself together' practising Buddhist meditation and living an ethical life as an ordained buddhist. However it is only through counselling that I have been able to address issues that experienced meditation practitioners could not help me with. There are good and bad counsellors - however find the person with the right skills and your life could change for the better.

Guy, England As much as I may not think therapists can help I only turn to self harm and suicide when I give it up. If this is a dependence, then I'm thankful for it and I owe it my life.

Doug, UK I have found therapy to be a waste of time. Rather then me get dependent on therapy, when I quit after 12 months of wasted money and zero progress, the therapist pursued me, insisting that I continue. I think he was more dependent on me then I was on him. Well, dependent on my cheques at least.

Emma, UK I've spent about half my life in therapy due to depression and I agree that therapy can become not addictive but more a crutch you feel you can't live without. Even good therapists will agree this is likely to happen. However the therapy I have had has been life-saving and well worth the possibility of developing a dependence on therapy.

Tomas, UK My daughter attended school 'counsellor' sessions - a dreadful period of time whereby an emotionally suspect person meddled with her mind. Frankly, it came to a head when the school stepped outside their mandate and it had to be stopped. When I questioned her on elements of her advice she claimed that she offered no advice 'simply wondered about things' - an interesting distinction that was probably wasted on a 13-year-old. Who polices the counsellor? Tread carefully down this route.

Patrick, Kent, UK I did basic counselling training two years ago and one of the first things we learnt is to be aware of clients becoming dependant. The whole objective of counselling is to help your client cope with their life. Modern lifestyles have increased the pressure on individuals and families and many people need to understand why they behave or react in the way that they do. This can then assist them to amend their behaviour in a more positive way. A good counsellor does not enforce his will upon his clients - he merely makes them look at various aspects of their life, asks how and why this could be affecting their current day-to-day living and then asks how the client thinks he might go about making changes that will help to make his life better.

Donna Chisholm, Staffs, UK It is only bad therapists who ""write a script"" for your life. The aim of therapy is to help you discover yourself and learn to help yourself. I am not a therapist, by the way.

Sarah, UK As a psychotherapist, having worked for years as an alcohol counsellor, I really must emphasise the point that, in my opinion, 12-step groups do foster dependence, and although they do save lives and are incredibly supportive to those most in need, the philosophy is shame-based, and is not conducive to people moving on and getting on with their lives. 12-step programmes are NOT equivalent to counselling or therapy.

Dermod Moore, United Kingdom It's obvious that people can get addicted to counselling - if something makes you feel better, you want to keep doing it. There are worse things for someone to be addicted to. People who have addictions will always be addicted to something - they may be addicted to a person, a relationship, a counsellor, gambling, food... but an addiction doesn't have to be harmful. It's sad that for many people counselling will fill a hole in their life and they will be addicted to it, but better that than alcohol or crime or self-harm.

The aim of therapy is to help you discover yourself and learn to help yourself.",http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4152301.stm,http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40698000/jpg/_40698081_sopranos_ap203.jpg
'I was an alcoholic doctor',,[],2005-06-13 16:10:52,"Dr Thomas Kenny worked in Accident & Emergency

Dr Thomas Gerard Kenny, 47, has spent the last year gaining a certificate in alcohol and addiction counselling in his hometown of Ballinasloe, Galway, in the Irish Republic.

I was probably an alcoholic from the first time I ever took a drink.

I was 17 and had just got the result of my leaving certificate at school in Ireland. It was just a few glasses of lager - but it changed me.

My parents were very disappointed because I have a family history of alcohol problems on my father's side. I vowed never to drink again.

But in college, when I did resume drinking, I didn't like the taste of pints so it was spirits from the start. There was a heavy drinking culture at my University. One particular pub in Galway was crowded at weekends with medical students falling all over the place.

Stressful job

It was the kind of bravado that was expected.

I could drink up to 10 shorts in an evening without getting physically sick like my contemporaries. Consequently, I got away with it for a long time before I began to think it was a problem.

My first job in England was as a locum senior house officer in Accident and Emergency at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.

My drinking was semi-controlled and secretive at this point. I didn't go to pubs, I bought alcohol in off-licences and took it back to my hospital room.

I do remember one consultant saying he presumed I'd had a glass of wine with my lunch - but it was probably a neat vodka



I was probably trying to disguise the smell of alcohol on me by chewing mints or garlic but nobody seemed to pass much heed.

I do remember one consultant saying he presumed I'd had a glass of wine with my lunch - but it was probably a neat vodka.

It was mostly when I was off duty, but I'm talking possibly a bottle of vodka a day. I might have a top up in the day if I could leave the environment of Casualty to go somewhere where I might have a bottle stashed.

Drunk at airport

I can see that was absolutely outrageous. But strangely enough, when I look back on all the patients I saw in that hospital, I didn't make any wrong decisions.

The Royal Free did investigate all the cases I'd seen and didn't find me at fault.

I'm not very proud of that but I'm relieved that nobody was injured or given the wrong treatment.

There were other senior house officers and a registrar so I would hand the patient over if I was unsure. I do accept it probably clouded my judgement. I tended to err on the side of caution.

There was one day I didn't make it into work because I was drinking at Dublin Airport and when I got to Luton in England I continued drinking until I practically passed out. The Casualty Registrar had to come and get me. That's when my problem became known in the hospital.

It was my pattern to run away and find another job



I went back to the hospital the next day and told a blatant lie, saying I'd gone.

Professor Glatt wasn't even in the country so they confronted me with this and then I found a reason to resign.

Shortly after that I went to Australia. It was my pattern to run away and find another job.

I became involved with the Doctors' Recovery Group in Brisbane. I was working in the outback, doing quite well. I had a sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous and saved enough money to buy a medical practice.

Then the Queensland Medical Board wrote to tell me they had received information from the GMC in London and were automatically erasing my name from their working list.

I left Australia.

Vulnerable patients

Three years ago, I was working in Northern Ireland as a locum senior house officer in psychiatry at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick.

I'd spent the intervening years in recovery, and was reinstated to the medical register.

But I lied by omission and was completely on the defensive all the time, covering up my background and places where I'd worked.

In Northern Ireland, I was plunged into areas of community psychiatry that I wasn't really qualified to do, and was doing the jobs of two people, but that's just by way of background rather than an excuse for what ultimately happened.

Coming back from a home visit, I stopped at a petrol station in a town called Castlewellan. I remember buying a bottle of vodka and going into the toilet and pouring it into an orange juice bottle. From the moment I did that, everything was a landslide.

I drove back to my residences and drank the vodka. I was on call but was unable to respond to my bleep. I just kept hoping it would go away.

It was a dreadful scenario that I faced, particularly in psychiatry where you are dealing with very vulnerable people who would often not be in a position to decipher whether a doctor had taken a drink.

Ask for help

I've been full of guilt and remorse. I've gone back over certain jobs that I did and racked my brains, trying to think whether I did something wrong. It was a cause of tremendous pain and angst for me.

I would tell any doctors reading this who are worried about their drinking not to be frightened to go for help.

There are all kinds of helpful situations within the fellowship of AA - the Sick Doctor Scheme and the Doctors' Recovery Group.

Safeguards are a little better now. People are more inclined to confront a colleague or perhaps lead them towards help. If that did happen in my situation, then I missed the signs.

But I still think there are many other Tom Kennys on both sides of the Irish Sea.

Faces of the week,,[],2006-08-04 17:46:00,"

Our regular look at some of the faces which have made the news this week. Above are Mel Gibson (main picture), with PARIS HILTON, FIDEL CASTRO, ABIGAIL WITCHALLS and CERYS MATTHEWS. Mel Gibson

Mel Gibson's spectacular fall off the wagon has caused outrage around the world. But will his drunken rant about Jews cost Hollywood's golden boy his glittering career? It was just after two o'clock in the morning of Friday 28 July when James Mee, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy, allegedly observed a man driving his 2006 Lexus LS at 87mph along the Pacific Coast Highway. Nothing really unusual there. But what came next was as shocking as it was unexpected. The occupant, Mel Gibson, swore about Jewish people before asking the arresting officer ""Are you a Jew?"" and ending his brief cameo appearance by saying, ""The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."" And the charges which followed - misdemeanour drunken driving, having an elevated blood-alcohol level and having an open container of liquor in his car - pale into insignificance beside the disgust and anger which his words have caused Jewish people and others. The question many people are asking is: was Mel Gibson shooting his mouth off without a clue as to what he was really saying, or did his outburst reveal his true colours? Mugshot: Mel Gibson following his arrest Gibson's apology, ""specifically to everyone in the Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words... Please know from my heart that I am not an anti-Semite,"" has drawn a mixed response. The veteran broadcaster Barbara Walters said on her ABC talk show: ""I don't think I want to see any more Mel Gibson movies."" But his long-time friend, actress Jodie Foster, leapt to his defence. ""Is he an anti-Semite? Absolutely not,"" Foster said. ""But it's no secret that he has always fought a terrible battle with alcoholism. I just wish I had been there, that I had been able to say, 'Don't do it. Don't take that drink.'"" And Jenni Frazer, senior writer at the Jewish Chronicle, says: ""Those who are predisposed not to like Jews in the first place will feel hearted and emboldened by his words. I'd be horrified that anyone would take what he said seriously."" This battle with drink first hit the headlines in 1984 when, after an initial flush of success, he succumbed to the booze during the filming of Mrs Soffel, with Diane Keaton. Conservative views Arrested for drunken driving, Gibson, 50, continued to drink to excess until his wife, Robyn Moore, persuaded him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous in 1991. Like many Hollywood superstars, Gibson's views - on a welter of subjects - are well-known. Although a practising Roman Catholic, he does not believe in evolution. He is staunchly opposed to abortion, supports capital punishment and has no time for feminists, saying ""feminists don't like me and I don't like them. I don't get their point"". Gibson won two Academy Awards for Braveheart in 1995 And he has remained loyal to a father, Hutton, who says that the Holocaust was mostly ""fiction"", once described the burning of heretics as ""an act of charity"" and believes that al-Qaeda was not to blame for the 9/11 attacks, and that the planes were ""crashed by remote control"" by the US government. And Gibson senior told one interviewer: ""They (the Jews) are after one world religion and one world government. That's why they have attacked the Catholic Church so strongly, to ultimately take control over it by their doctrine"". His son has consistently refused to condemn him and has even blacklisted reporters who pressed the issue. Controversy Both men are adherents to the Traditional Catholic movement, a conservative group which supports the Latin Tridentine Mass and seeks to return the Church to its position before the reforms instituted by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. There has also been much speculation that the latest outburst might fatally damage Gibson's professional future. But the star is in an exalted position. Following the huge success of his 1980s action movies, he formed his own production company, Icon Entertainment. Icon was behind his 2003 film, The Passion of the Christ, which Gibson produced, wrote and directed. The Passion generated huge controversy. It was accused of being unnecessarily violent, anti-Semitic and of departing from biblical text. Some historians saw The Patriot as anti-English But it was also hugely successful, earning more than $600m worldwide. It's the kind of money that talks, especially in Tinseltown. As Jenni Frazer says ""Gibson managed to buck the Hollywood system with The Passion of the Christ. He can afford to tell his critics, 'I don't care'. But he is apologising. ""If someone in Hollywood is making you money you can forgive all. But some will eat with a long spoon and keep their distance. Others will bite their tongues."" Gibson was slammed by British critics and historians for perceived anti-English bias and inaccuracies in films like Braveheart and The Patriot. But even so, the star of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon may well be hoping that his latest feature, the police video of his drunken rant, will not reach the screen. If this was to happen, Mel Gibson's very own year of living dangerously may yet throw up a surprise ending. Paris Hilton

All-round woman of the world, Paris Hilton, has confessed that she would not recognise the UK's Prime Minister. Asked by GQ magazine if she fancied Tony Blair, the hotelier, parfumier, candid film star and putative pop diva replied ""Who?"" After a few moments mulling the matter over, she said: ""Oh yeah... he's like your president?"" Then she admitted: ""I don't know what he looks like."" Hilton's debut single, Stars are Blind, is released this week. Fidel Castro

The President of Cuba, Fidel Castro, has temporarily handed over power to his brother, Raul. Castro, who is set to turn 80 on 13 August, says he needs several weeks' rest after an operation for intestinal bleeding. This is the first time since Castro took power in 1959 that he has relinquished any control. In a message to the Cuban people he said his health was ""stable"" and ""as for my spirits, I feel perfectly fine."" Full story Abigail Witchalls

Stabbing victim Abigail Witchalls has visited the French shrine of Lourdes. According to her parents, she was in search of spiritual support to help ""the family to live with Abigail's continuing, severe paralysis"". The paralysed mother-of-two and her family joined the annual pilgrimage of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton to the holy site. Abigail and her husband, Benoit, have both visited the spot, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, on a number of previous occasions. Full story Cerys Matthews

Former Catatonia front-woman Cerys Matthews has revealed that Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam) helped her to kick a heroin habit. Matthews, whose new album, Never Said Goodbye, is released later this month, found herself hooked on the drug in 2001. Struggling with rehab, Cerys found encouragement from Bob and Cat. ""I had telephone calls from them which gave me the confidence to follow what my heart was telling me, which was to get out."" Full story Written by BBC News Profiles Unit's Andrew Walker

Intrv And how do they actually do that, they can use that to cross reference.





Lee Well that's right I mean there's an enormous amount of, of public record data that's available about people, erm, and certainly in the United States for instance, erm, there are lots and lots of records. Some of these are voting er, ......, erm other kinds of public records that will contain peoples true name and address and gender, so what they can do is they can figure out erm, by cross linking those records with the information they have and say oh, well you know, this is the only person in this postal code erm, who is of that age erm and of that gender, and that way they will be able to figure out who you are.





Intrv Is personal information more valuable than cash.





Lee Its hard to say just how valuable personal information er, on the web is. I think that most companies would rather have cash to start with but the information is coming to them almost for free. Erm, that is the er, your quick stream data just comes to the website, comes to advertisers er, without your, without your actually having to do anything other than just going er, going and clicking on things. So it's a very, very cheap and unobtrusive erm, form of ............. I mean probably the best thing about it is that its so unobtrusive, you don't know er, you're giving it up and so its seems entirely free to you. And then the consequences of it, maybe you get certain kinds of ads, maybe you get er, telephone solicitations. But you have no way of knowing that that's because, you know you clicked on 17 things on these 5 websites, and so whatever it is that you are paying for you don't really make a connection to the er information you are giving up. And I think you know, frankly people see cash, individuals see cash differently because its something that comes straight out of their pocket, erm, the information they give up, they don't see it leaving and they don't know what anyone's doing with it.





Intrv How do we pay when we visit a free website.





Lee Well when you visit a supposedly free website, its sort of like a sophisticated version of watching free TV, erm, you know, there is content that's being presented to you, erm, somebody's paying for it, how do they get paid back. Well in the, you know, the old TV world, at least in the United States where its, you know, based on ads, erm, what's really happening is the content is a product that's sold to advertisers, and what are advertisers buying, advertisers are buying audience, and so they pay to be able to put their advertisement in front of you. And the same thing is happening on the web, advertisers pay websites in order to put ads in front of them. The main sort of extra dimension on the web is that they're also paying for the information that they get from when you visit websites, to help them decide which ads they want to target, they want to put ads. And you know, TV is a non and interactive media, right, they don't know you are watching, erm, with the web its, the information stream goes both ways. When you pick, click on something they know you spend a certain amount of time on it. They may know you spent more time on an article about erm, er, contraceptives than about er, er, breast cancer, and all this kind of information about what it is that you're interested in gets used by advertisers to figure out how they are going to target erm, then it goes a step further right, I mean because they're building up, essentially profiles, they are building up dossiers and files about the people who visit various websites. Erm, and they will be able to glean that, you know, you are a person who likes to travel, you are a person who er, likes to cook and so on and so forth. And being able to target you as a person for those kinds of ads is again something that advertisers are worth paying, are will to pay for. Because advertising in the ordinary world is an extremely inefficient media that you are sending an ad to lots and lots of people and what percentage of those people are actually likely to or willing to you know, buy your goods or services. The amount of information that's available about people's preferences on the web enables them to be much more precise in how they advertise and therefore how they, how they sell.

Faces of the week,,[],2003-08-30 10:21:16,"

Our regular look at some of the faces which have made the news this week. Above are Michael Barrymore (main picture), with Kelly Holmes, Sir Ian McKellen, Cameron Diaz and Sir Cliff Richard (clockwise from top left). Click for more MICHAEL BARRYMORE

There were always two Michael Barrymores. On stage or television, in total command. Without the performer's mask, an insecure and vulnerable man, his life spinning out of control and leaving emotional casualties in the wake of its reckless flight. He was one of Britain's top light entertainment stars, until 30 March, 2001, when the body of a man he scarcely knew was found in the swimming pool of Barrymore's home at Roydon in Essex. Although an inquest did not implicate the presenter in the death of 31-year-old Stuart Lubbock, television bosses sacked Barrymore after an open verdict. And while Barrymore, 51, is to begin a one-man show in London's West End next month, he says the public will decide whether he returns to TV screens. Born Micheal Ciaran Parker 4 May 1952 Left St Michael's RC school at 15 A Redcoat at Butlins in Clacton Played keyboards with band called Fine China The entertainer says he has now been teetotal and drug free for two and a half years, although he would be ""in danger"" if he stopped attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. Michael Barrymore is confronting a reality he has avoided most of his life. He discovered the value of laughter as a boy in Bermondsey in south London. Anarchic humour One night, when their drinking, gambling father keeled over, young Michael and his brother took money from his pocket and went to the cinema. ""I was eight or nine and I'd never seen a film, and it was a Norman Wisdom film and I laughed for two hours and forgot about the problems at home."" It seems his own, anarchic humour couldn't be suppressed. When he travelled around Europe, playing keyboards with a rock band, he would stand on his head, in an impersonation of Alan Whicker Down Under. Michael Barrymore leaves the Stuart Lubbock inquest When he worked in Selfridge's toy department, they took a dim view of Barrymore setting up a toy picket line during the firefighters' strike. Two events in the 1970s paved the way to success. He won the television talent show, New Faces, and married Cheryl, a former dancer who became his manager. Barrymore's career went from strength to strength. Viewers loved his old-fashioned, music-hall routine on Strike it Lucky and My Kind of Music. Surrogate son His zany antics were reminiscent of Danny Kaye, while he had a Bruce Forsyth-like ability to send-up his guests without quite crossing the line into callousness. ""Unlike other comedians who mock the public, Barrymore convinces you he likes them,"" says another entertainer, Graham Norton. ""And we like him for it."" But his manic style needed a stable base. In 1991, he was hit hard by the death of Cheryl's father, who had adopted him as a surrogate son. ""I felt abandoned. I was angry that he'd died and left me."" I still love her, I've always loved here. She knows me better than anyone

Michael Barrymore talking about his ex-wife, Cheryl Four years later, his coming-out as a gay man spelt the end of his marriage. And when another stabilising influence left him -- his partner, Shaun Davis - Barrymore's life spiralled out of control. While he was in rehab in Arizona, he was told his mother had terminal cancer. Now, though, he is back with his partner and Michael Barrymore is sober and keen to work, even though for him, fame is the sharpest of two-edged swords. ""Give me an audience and I could do anything,"" he says. ""Take me away from that and I couldn't cope."" The burden of being a 24/7 celebrity has all but broken Barrymore before, but he says he has learned through AA that ""when you face your fears, you can deal with them."" A return to the glare of television might prove the sternest of tests for that belief. KELLY HOLMES

Britain's Kelly Holmes didn't give a hoot about the suggestion that her friend Maria Mutola had helped her to an 800 metres silver medal at the world athletics championships in Paris. A Russian rival complained that they conspired to deprive her of second place. But Holmes was adamant: ""I could have done it without Maria. But when the best in the world has that much belief in you, it gives you confidence."" Full story IAN MCKELLEN

Sir Ian McKellen, an Oscar nominee for his role as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, called for gay Hollywood stars to come out of the closet and stop duping their fans. Sir Ian, 64, who's been a leading campaigner for gay rights since he declared his sexuality in 1988, said studio executives were telling actors not to come out because of audience hostility. ""That is just bull,"" he said. Full story CAMERON DIAZ

With a string of box-office successes, Charlie's Angels star Cameron Diaz entered the Guinness Book of World Records when her annual earnings of £25m outstripped even those of Julia Roberts. But Roberts' battle for a better deal for actresses has yet to be won. Diaz is set to pick up £13m for her next film, a remake of Fun With Dick And Jane, while her co-star Jim Carrey will double that. Full story SIR CLIFF RICHARD

Sir Cliff Richard revealed the strain he faces in trying to be the forever Young One, the Peter Pan of Pop. Heading for 64, he's stopped using Botox to iron out his wrinkles because it gave him droopy eyebrows. Sir Cliff, who raised many an eyebrow after lending his Barbadian villa to the prime minister, said he wasn't against cosmetic surgery: ""But if I wasn't a celebrity, I wouldn't care about how much things dropped or drooped.""

Should alcoholics get liver transplants?,,['Richard Warry'],2003-07-14 16:19:28,"By Richard Warry

BBC News Online health staff



Best has been drinking again

Some say it is a waste of a precious and scarce resource, but others say there is no reason why people suffering from such a debilitating disease should be discriminated against.

The George Best case may give the impression that people suffering from alcoholism take their place in the transplant queue like any other person with severe liver disease.

In fact, this is not the case. Many units operate a vigorous screening policy to determine whether there is a good chance that a patient will give up dangerous drinking following surgery.

If the signs are bad, then they may very well be denied a transplant.

The Scottish Liver Transplant Unit in Edinburgh is one which takes this line.

It is headed by Mr John Forsythe, vice president of the British Transplantation Society.

We have a duty of care to the recipient which is obvious, but we also feel we have a duty of care to the donor family

Mr John Forsythe

""Alternatively, you could say that that these patients should always be considered for a transplant, but that is plainly ridiculous.

""In cases where the likelihood of recidivism is high that would mean a vital resource given after a lot of thought by a donor family is likely to be wasted.

""That leaves us with something in between. We have a robust procedure to assess whether there is a good chance that a patient will not return to harmful drinking.

""If there is, then we will consider surgery. After all we have a duty of care to the recipient which is obvious, but we also feel we have a duty of care to the donor family.""

Mr Forsythe said the chances of a patient returning to dangerous levels of drinking following surgery were low. Around 15-20% of patients do drink following surgery, but only about 2% of these do so at levels which could damage their new liver.

Long-term commitment

Just simply saying 'I'm never going to drink again' is not good enough - anybody could say that

Dr Robert Lefever

""People need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous and demonstrate that they understanding that they have to make a long-term commitment to tackling their problems,"" he said.

""Just simply saying 'I'm never going to drink again' is not good enough - anybody could say that.""

Many would question whether George Best was a suitable candidate for surgery.

But his surgeon is not one of them. Professor Roger Williams said Best's weekend drinking session - which included a scuffle with a photographer, was a temporary lapse.

""Up to about a week ago he had been in extraordinarily good form,"" he said.

""He was at a House of Commons reception to launch a joint parliamentary group on liver disease and I had never seen him look so well, or talk so well. He was altogether a transformed person.""

Sympathy required

Best's wife Alex has stood by him

He said: ""This isn't like swapping over a component in your car. If you get a new liver, it doesn't stop the problems you had which got you into trouble in the first place.

""I'm sure George Best was absolutely sincere in his wish to stop drinking.

""But drinking in this country is almost how you define yourself, and sitting at home with a glass of orange juice is not what a guy like him has been used to.

""How he leads his life, where his mates are, what he does is down the pub, and it's a tough call to cut that out of your life.""

Mr Appleby rejected the idea that alcoholics should be made a low priority for a liver transplant.

""Whatever aspect of health you look at there is always some contributory factor.

""What we need to ensure is that those people who do get transplants actually get the help and support they need to make the most of it.""

Deepak Mahtani is from the organisation Transplants in Mind, which works to increase public awareness of the benefits of organ donation.

He said everybody deserved equal treatment from the NHS - including George Best.

""When he received the liver transplant a year ago he made a resolution to stop drinking, and I do believe he was sincere in that.

""Nevertheless, drinking is part of the society in which we live, and he is only human with human frailties.""

Mr Mahtani accepted that the negative publicity surrounding Best might put some people off donating their organs.

""I have heard people saying 'why should we register on the organ donor register if our organs are going to be wasted in this way'. But I don't think this is the rule, this is an exception.""

Media criticism

Best also won support from Labour MP Helen Clark, a member of the all-party hepatology group, which the footballer helped to launch last week.

She criticised the media for adding to the pressure on Best by camping outside the pub in which he was seen drinking.

""George hadn't touched a drop of alcohol for three years, and nobody knows what caused this blip.

""He is not an evil, wicked person behaving in a terrible, bad way, he is ill, and he does need help.""","['best', 'duty', 'liver', 'need', 'donor', 'say', 'george', 'transplant', 'good', 'transplants', 'alcoholics', 'drinking']","The George Best case may give the impression that people suffering from alcoholism take their place in the transplant queue like any other person with severe liver disease.

What Gazza's going through,,[],1998-10-13 19:24:17,"Nobody goes into rehabilitation treatment willingly. Even those, like me, who went voluntarily, do so in a moment of crisis.

It is the last refuge of hope before the total destruction of your life. And you have no idea what awaits you.

Inside a new world awaits, with its own language. Words and phrases like 'Powerlessness' and 'Unmanageability', 'Power Greater Than Me' and 'Relapse' are bandied about.

You are even given a new name. No longer Fred, or Peter or Kevin. Now it is: ""Kevin, I'm an addict"". ""Fred, I'm duly addicted (drugs and alcohol)"".

When I arrived at my centre I had never heard of the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous; I had no idea that this was the cornerstone of conventional drug treatment.

We were taught to teach ourselves that we were powerless over drugs and that it was taking the first drug that caused the most damage. I learned quickly.

'I am somebody'

The day is long. It has routine, with affirmations in the morning, along the lines of: ""Hello, I'm Kevin, I'm an addict. I have the right to happiness. I have the right to be loved. I am a kind gentle person.""

We all finished the same way: ""I am somebody.""

Again and again throughout the month that phrase drummed itself in that we were not just worthless druggies.

In between all of this there was group therapy, also known as the Minnesota Method.

The Method is much copied around the world and is in use at The Priory, where Gazza is staying.

Tough love

The idea is that the group of which you are part does most of the work. ""Trust in the Process"" is repeated again and again.

You present course work on topics such as ""How I tried to give up drugs before"" or ""The financial costs of my addiction"" or ""The damage I have done to myself.""

Presenting such material is stressful. Tears are the norm. The rules are strict. You MUST NOT pass anyone crying a tissue. It breaks the flow and stems the flood of natural angst.

Such 'tough love' breaks down any final resolve that we can be social users or that drugs have not caused damage to our lives.

The rest of the group is then asked to relate often a brutal account of their own similarities. This bonds the group.

Through this process other issues lying behind the drugs and booze come out. Some relate to family or origin, some are personality traits, some involve horrendous events like multiple rape.

It seems no one in the room has had a normal happy upbringing and adult life, yet before long you feel normal within this group.

It is dealing with these and other issues that will take years of therapy if those like me are not to return to active addiction.

'The hardest thing I have ever done'

Within weeks you feel this is the only place you belong. The rules annoy you, the staff seem petty, the cost - at $10,000 for 28 days - is horrendous, but you rapidly realise this group of people actually care about whether you make it.

Many do not make it. One person I went through treatment with is dead. Many are back in rehab. The 30% success rate is optimistic.

It is, without doubt, the hardest thing I have ever done. I still attend NA or AA meetings regularly - not regularly enough, some would say - and I am trying to work to a programme.

I am aware that if I return to active addiction the likely ending is prison or death. I have tried one, sailed close to the other, and do not wish for the third.

After all, I am somebody.","['idea', 'went', 'work', 'tried', 'damage', 'gazzas', 'kevin', 'im', 'group', 'drugs', 'world', 'going']","Now it is: ""Kevin, I'm an addict"".

Spielberg to direct and produce the Japanese drama

Steven Speilberg's next film, Memoirs of a Geisha, will star two unknown Japanese actresses, chosen from thousands who answered an advertisement in the showbiz press.

Newcomers, Rika Okamoto, a former dancer and Julyana Soelistyo, a Broadway actress, will co-star in the epic drama set in the decadent world of pre-World War Two geishas.

The film, based on Arthur Golden's novel, tells the story of a nine-year-old girl who was sold into slavery in 1929 and became one of Japan's most renowned geishas. It will begin shooting in Japan early next year.

Schiffer: second model to cut restaurant ties

Supermodel Claudia Schiffer has become the latest founding member of the Fashion Café restaurant chain to cut ties with the failing business.

Following the example of fellow supermodel Christy Turlington who pulled out last year, Schiffer said the chain's failure to address its persistent problems had made it ""simply impossible"" for her to continue to be associated with it.

The restaurants, now left to Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson, are reported to be facing severe financial problems and a decline in the number of diners.

Arthur Lowe as Captain Mannering

The complete scripts for six early recordings of Dad's Army, the classic British sitcom about the Home Guard, are to be published for the first time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of one of TV's most enduring comedy favourites.

All but one of the tapes of the six episodes recorded for series two were wiped for re-use after their first broadcast in 1969 and never seen again.

Dad's Army: The Lost Episodes, which includes unique photographs taken by writers Jimmy Perry and David Croft, will be in the shops from September 17th.

Faces of the week,,[],2003-08-15 15:40:24,"

Our regular look at some of the faces which have made the news this week. Above are Mel Gibson (main picture), with Dr Robert Atkins, Alex Best, Sir Jack Hayward and Diana Mosley (clockwise from top left). Click for more MEL GIBSON

Mad Mel or Brave heart? The storm over Mel Gibson's film, The Passion, is intensifying after a leading Jewish-American group had a private screening. He infuriated some critics with his villainous depiction of the British Redcoats in his American Revolution epic, The Patriot. Now he is provoking anger from several quarters with his film about the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ. For the unwitting, Mel Gibson is the action hero of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon. ""I'm not going to say that gay is all right. That's my belief, and I can't be intimidated into changing my mind.""

Mel Gibson He may have impressed as Hamlet, but is more frequently remembered as an international sex symbol with the twinkling blue eyes, his buttocks bared more than once in the interests of the box office. His Hollywood CV also includes the requisite drink-drive episode and the visits to Alcoholics Anonymous to wean him from a lifestyle in which he drank five beers before breakfast. ""I felt I was in hell. I hated work and I felt lost,"" he said. Speaking in tongues Mel Gibson, ex-drinker, and still battling the nicotine habit, is dedicated to his wife of 23 years, Robyn, his seven children, and the faith that is driving his latest, hugely-controversial project. The Passion graphically portrays Christ's suffering on his way to the Cross and his lingering, bloody death. The film is four hours long and the actors speak only in Latin, the language of the Romans, or Aramaic, the tongue of the local people. No subtitles are planned. Gibson doesn't appear in the film, but has co-written, directed and financed the project with £16m of his own money. Its release is planned for Ash Wednesday next year, even though it has yet to attract a distributor. Double Oscar winner with Braveheart The film claims to be the Gospel truth and, says Gibson, is meant to ""inspire, not offend"". But it has already disturbed Catholics and Protestants and angered some Jewish groups, who are worried about the possible repercussions of the movie, which, they feel, portrays a cabal of Jews determined to secure the Crucifixion of Jesus. ""We are deeply concerned that the film, if released in its present form, will fuel the hatred, bigotry and anti-Semitism that many responsible churches have worked hard to repudiate,"" says Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League. It may be common knowledge that Mel Gibson is not an authentic ""fair-dinkum"" Aussie. One of 11 children, he was born in New York state and taken to Australia when he was 12 by his father so that he and his brothers could avoid the Vietnam draft. Not quite so well known are Gibson's beliefs as an ultra-Conservative Catholic traditionalist. He belongs to a splinter movement, the Holy Family. Mel's milestones Born Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson, 1956, in New York State. The sixth of 11 children. Studied at the University of New South Wales Named the Sexiest Man Alive in 1985 It refuses to accept the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, which in 1965 formally rejected the notion that the Jews were collectively responsible for killing Christ. Gibson is bankrolling the building of a new church for the Holy Family in Malibu, California, where he and his family worship. They say Mass in Latin, refrain from eating meat on Fridays and the women cover their heads. The movement believes that reforming liberals in the Vatican have made the modern church structure rotten to the core. Mel Gibson's declaration that homosexuality was against the will of the Lord provoked protest from America's gay community. Now he seems set to provoke the Jewish members who have always been an integral part of his industry. ""Maybe I'm crazy,"" he says. ""But maybe I'm a genius."" Dr ROBERT ATKINS

The debate continues to rage about the value or otherwise of the Atkins Diet. Dr Robert Atkins, who died this year, believed that carbohydrates over-stimulate the production of insulin, resulting in hunger and weight gain. His diet recommends a tenth of carbohydrate intake. Two months ago, two teams of American scientists sanctioned it. Now, a leading nutritionist from Cambridge has denounced both the Atkins Diet as potentially dangerous and the research that supported it as meaningless. Now, where's that doughnut? Full story ALEX BEST

After eight years of nursing him through alcoholism and a subsequent liver transplant, Alex Best's marriage to soccer legend George is on the rocks. For so are George's drinks. But not only is he still boozing, he has also been seeing another woman. A distraught Alex has gone off for a girlie holiday, while George has received a visit from his irate mother-in-law. That should have him reaching for the bottle. Readers of the Daily Star have demanded he give his new liver back. DIANA MOSLEY

The death took place this week of Diana Mosley, one of the famed Mitford sisters. Her beauty was legendary but her thoughts were ugly. After dazzling London society in the 1930s, she left her husband for the British fascist leader, Sir Oswald Mosley. Adolf Hitler attended their wedding. During the War, she and her husband were interned as a danger to the state. An MI5 document described Lady Mosley as ""far cleverer and more dangerous than her husband"". Full story Sir JACK HAYWARD

The rich vein of the Guardian's corrections and clarifications corner produced another gem. The paper had reported Sir Jack Hayward, the chairman of newly-promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers, apparently slagging off his players, saying: ""Our team was the worst in the First Division and I'm sure it will be the worst in the Premiership"". Apologising for misquoting Sir Jack, the Guardian said he had in fact been referring to the club's tea. Full story Compiled by Chris Jones, BBC News Profiles Unit

From Our Own Correspondent,,[],1999-02-08 01:27:23,"The trial of sacked Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, which resumes on Monday, has left many Malaysians disillusioned with their government and with politics in general.





I have just been to Kelantan, a state in the north east of Malaysia which has been ruled for 10 years by the Islamic PAS party. It is often described as an outpost of Islamic fundamentalism in the heart of south east Asia.





It is not that the local government wants to be lenient. It has been forbidden from imposing such draconian measures by the more secular minded authorities in the federal capital Kuala Lumpur.

Fun is forbidden

So Kelantan has focused on sex and booze. Visiting this state is like being back at boarding school, or staying with my grandparents at the age of 10. All the fun things are forbidden.

It goes without saying that the most intoxicating drink in your hotel mini-bar is a fluorescent orangeade: no alcohol but aggressively fizzy.





The Anwar trial has disillusioned people

The genders have to stand in separate queues at the supermarket - just in case they should be over-come by passion while waiting to pay for their frozen peas.

And, perhaps most bizarrely of all, the lights in Kelantan's three cinemas are never fully dimmed, so that the ushers can spot which couples are no longer concentrating on the film's plot, and tell the authorities.

The morally righteous man

The man who dreamt up most of these rules is Chief Minister Nik Aziz. A a kind, devout and humble mullah, Nik Aziz is revered like a saint by his followers. He has shunned the official chief minister's residence and lives in his native village.

His party's support is growing nation-wide. The political purge of the former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has brought out the worst in the ruling party and its autocratic prime minister.

Such is the disillusionment with the Mahatir government that even some secular Malays are flocking to PAS. Like most clerical politicians, Nick Aziz is not exactly tortured with self doubt.





Swimming for girls means diving in fully clothed

It is the warped but iron-clad logic of the morally righteous.

But what makes Nik Aziz's mission for morality seem almost heroic is its futility. Squeaky clean Kelantan has the geographical misfortune of bordering southern Thailand.

Sin next door





The Islamic movement is growing rapidly

It is a one-way traffic into Thailand. Hundreds of cars cross the frontier of sin every day, driving past giant posters warning of the dangers of Aids.

While new garish hotels are sprouting on the Thai side, Kelantan with its deserted golden beaches has only one resort hotel, where the swimming pool is green and viscous and the cockroaches make you feel like the intruder. In other words the kind of place where you absolutely need a double whiskey to survive.

""Why,"" I asked Nik Aziz, ""did he think tourism had collapsed in Kelantan?""

""Perhaps,"" he explained, ""people have not yet understood the pleasures of a pure, clean vacation. Things need to be explained better!"" Holidays of abstinence - guaranteed sun, sea and sobriety.

How do you make children's films appeal to adults?,,['Finlo Rohrer'],2009-12-16 11:54:37,"Pixar and Dreamworks Animation have been instrumental in the trend

By Finlo Rohrer

BBC News Magazine

You might be forgiven for thinking children's films are for children and adults have their own films. But 2009 - with the likes of Up and Where the Wild Things Are - has seen the triumph of the trend towards making children's films that speak to grown-ups too. Anyone who has ever ventured into a children's Saturday matinee will recognise the following. A hubbub. Not like that at pub or party, but a persistent susurration as children ask ""Mummy, why is the fox friends with the rabbit?"" and riffle their popcorn like a prospector panning for gold. Above this child-centred cacophony is the film, and how the adult custodians feel about that film defines whether or not they are happy to brave this whispered maelstrom to see the sequel in 18 months time. CHILDREN MAY NOT NOTICE... The Lion King: echoes of Hamlet Chicken Run: loose parody of The Great Escape Wall-E: Wall-E and shiny white robot Eve make noise like Apple Mac booting The Incredibles: discussion of dangers of baddies 'monologuing' and allowing hero to escape Up: the old man is styled to look like Spencer Tracy Finding Nemo: seagull scene echoes Hitchcock's The Birds The Hollywood moguls didn't get where they are without being aware that the ultimate film is one that audiences of every age and type can sit through. If the adults think there is something in it for them, they may even be more sympathetic to the shameless wave of merchandising aimed at their pestering offspring. In recent years, this has led to ""children's"" films being replete with the kind of jokes that adults know are aimed at them. A green ogre voiced by Mike Myers in 2001 was a notable example. ""Shrek was seized upon as a turning point in that it had very definitely one kind of a text for kids and definitely a subtext for adults,"" says Justin Johnson, head of the Children's Film Programme at the British Film Institute. Shrek was not the first to have jokes aimed at adults, but the sheer volume and the self-consciousness of the tactic stood out to reviewers. The earlier Toy Story movies had contained jokes that would have been lost on children, particularly in the form of references to other films. John Lasseter has been one of the key figures in Pixar's success In Toy Story 2, the scenes where Rex is seen in the rear view mirror pursuing the jeep in a parody of Jurassic Park, or the part where Zurg falls down the shaft a la Return of the Jedi, are going to be missed by many children. And in the first Toy Story film, Buzz Lightyear's existential crisis after he discovers he is ""just"" a toy, is a profoundly adult theme. In Finding Nemo, there is a double layer joke in the idea that sharks could form an Alcoholics Anonymous-style group to help them give up fish. The fact that this diet would be deleterious to real sharks is supposed to provoke a further internal chuckle. This year's Up represented a high water mark for the tactic, says Tony Earnshaw, head of film programming at the National Media Museum. ""There are so many layers to that film. It is more than just a standard cartoon or animated movie."" There has to be a smorgasbord of appeal in these modern family films to keep the adults interested, he says. ""If there isn't, all they can do is listen to the kids crunch popcorn and slurp their drinks."" No matter how many references you hang around them if you haven't got a good story you haven't got a good film

Justin Johnson

BFI It is not just pure animations that blur the boundaries. Much of the critics' reception for the Spike Jonze's adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are seems to centre on the idea that it is not really a children's story at all. Jonze seemed to confirm it himself when he told an American newspaper: ""The main goal wasn't to make a children's movie. I wanted to make a movie about childhood."" Perhaps such an approach is inevitable when adults are asked to adapt a work that was important to them in their childhood. There is certainly a question of what is a children's film. Are there, in fact, only ""family"" films? Why is there a presumption that an animation is aimed at children, unless demonstrated otherwise? Ayn Rand? The Incredibles, released in 2004, satirises the litigiousness of US society, as those saved by superheroes take legal action against them, forcing their saviours into an equivalent of the witness protection programme. Adherents of the individualist thinker Ayn Rand analysed the movie through the prism of her philosophy, noting that the film appears to attack the oppressive egalitarianism that forces superheroes to disguise their powers. In The Incredibles, the superhero mother tells her son: ""Everyone's special."" He replies sotto voce: ""Which is another way of saying no one is."" For many this Pseuds Corner type analysis of an animated family comedy is just a bit too much. And there are also films that have been criticised for going too far in their attempts to amuse the adults in the audience. After the success of Shrek, the sequel has a sight gag allusion to the beach kissing scene in From Here to Eternity early on and proceeds with a slew of references from there, including the notion of Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), having a poster of Justin Timberlake (Diaz's then boyfriend). But by Shrek the Third, some may be getting a bit worn out by the grown-up cultural references. The Simpsons was a cartoon for adults from the start ""By Shrek the Third, the films got outdated - the references were so contemporary,"" says Mr Johnson. One can't imagine watching in 30 years time and it all still working. Some questioned why 2004's Shark Tale was constructed around references to The Godfather. ""They were building the film around their voice cast,"" says Mr Johnson. He says that when the pop references are done well, they are unobtrusive to the watching children and those adults who are slow on the uptake. ""It's very covert. It isn't a kind of showstopper. Shrek the Third was just one gag after another. ""In terms of the fundamental good family film, the story is absolutely the driver. No matter how many references you hang around them if you haven't got a good story you haven't got a good film."" Below is a selection of your comments. As an adult, the most touching moment I recall was in Finding Nemo. The scene at the beginning, where Marlin is excited by becoming a father, then has to come to terms with losing his wife and all but one of their eggs to a barracuda was so like my own sense of loss at a miscarriage that I had to leave the cinema to compose myself. It was the first - and only - time I have cried in public as an adult.

Anonymous Man, UK I can't help but feel that the movie industry hasn't invented something new here - you only need to pick up any Asterix book to find numerous layers of humour that your average child reader would not have picked up on. Examples: - Two Roman legionaries in the book Asterix in Britain being called Sendhervictorius and Appianglorious. The village druid being called Getafix. These are of course jokes in the English translations, as the original French references were more politically driven and so would not have made any sense in the UK.

Steve, London Buzz Lightyear bears an uncanny resemblance to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and I'm convinced it's no accident. In Toy Story 2 there's even a scene where Buzz plays with a toy keyboard and it displays the message: ""Nice try Brian."" I can't be sure but I'll bet a Canadian played a large role in the development of Buzz. I know that most of the film's viewers never got the joke, but some Canadians certainly did.

Gary Blakeley, Toronto, Canada Nothing new about adult references in children's entertainment. I remember re-watching an old Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 1970s as an adult and suddenly realising it was a (brilliant) parody of the opera, the Marriage of Figaro.

Legis, Harpenden, UK The Lion King films are all based around Shakespeare, in a way. The first is Hamlet, as the article says, while the second is Romeo & Juliet and the third - a retelling of the original story from the perspective of the comic relief characters - is essentially Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Yes, I spend far too much time analysing children's films.

Olly, Bournemouth Surely one of the best cartoons with double meanings is/was television's Dangermouse where every other line seemed to be a double entendre or subtle adult joke.

Steve, London While I can enjoy a bit of double meaning, it has gone so far and the pop cultural references so many, that these types of films have lost their charm and even have made me wonder if the target audience isn't adults rather than children. Every character nowadays has to be based on a wise cracking rapper or some cynical anti-hero. I enjoyed Shrek, but even then I felt that it was aimed at too old an audience. I used to hate the naive, cute Disney classics, but now as a father of a three-year-old, I find that I have almost nothing in his age bracket to entertain him apart from Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh. The fact that the new computer animated Winnie the Pooh is made in such a 'cool' way, with costumes and extraneous characters is a reason he doesn't like it.

Mariusz, Australia I don't see anything mentioned about the most unfortunate sexual references and crude humor that ruin most of these so called children's films. These are marked PG for a reason - they are not really suitable for children - unless you don't mind having crude, rude children who are sexualised early in life. Although I found Up to be an exception, the Barbie references in Toy Story, and the lewd and crude comments in Shrek are truly offensive. Please allow there to be films for kids - parents should be allowed to enjoy their own films. I can't imagine my folks feeling they had to be entertained by my kiddie matinees. Our kid movies were just for - kids.

Enfants6, Nevada City, USA We all know that Chicken Run was a remake of The Great Escape but who noticed that the chicken who couldn't lay eggs was called Edwina.

Russell O'Brien, Nottingham I particularly liked Shark Tale where there is a glimpse of the nude pencil portrait of Rose from Titanic wearing the Heart of the Ocean necklace.

Di, The Castleton, North Yorks A friend and I went to see Where The Wild Things are at the weekend (we're both in our early 20s) and loved it - but we definitely got more out of it than the children in the cinema. They seemed to lost interest and got fidgety while their parents were absorbed in the brilliant psychological representation of the Wild Things as aspects of Max; definitely more for people like me who grew up with the book.

Tegan H, Birmingham, UK One of the best sources of adult humour in children's video was the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" animated US TV series in the early 60s. It was loaded with jokes and puns that only an adult would appreciate, and some which likely zoomed over the heads of many adults. It was very popular with high-school and college students of the era (though likely very few older adults discovered it).

Dan, Byron, MN USA I'm always interested in how a lot of family TV/film works on so many levels and provide something for everyone. Once I was watching an episode of The Simpsons with a group of friends, all around the same age but of different backgrounds, and noticed that we were all laughing, but at different things. As well as the cultural references mentioned quite a lot in this article, family TV/films can send up reality or contain humour that's a bit more grown-up than the usual kiddies' slapstick - so even if the cultural references become dated in the future, there's still plenty to keep teens and adults amused. Hopefully they will stand the test of time.

More than three million of us are so addicted to alcohol that we cannot get through the day without a drink, according to the charity Alcohol Concern.

Alcohol plays a part in one million admissions to casualty every year - and its longer term effects are thought to cost the NHS around £1.7bn annually.

More worrying still, women's drinking habits are rapidly catching up with men's. Stressed-out female executives are now more likely to develop a drink problem than their male colleagues.

We debated the issues with Dr Vivienne Nathanson from the British Medical Association and Jean Coussins from the Portman Group. Click here to watch the above discussion Both felt more needs to be done to standardise labelling as units do not accurately record volume and strength. They also said we need to be responsible and give our bodies appropriate rests between drinking sessions. We spoke to the Home Office Minister Hazel Blears. She said binge drinking is not only a problem for the individual but also the community: ""Binge drinking is bad for person and community."" The problem areas are the young people who go out specifically to get drunk, and the chronic drinkers who are increasingly ending up with heart and liver problems. Both lower productivity, cause pressure on the NHS and some create problems for the Local Authorities i.e. by breaking things and causing rubbish. We need a partnership with pubs, industry, government and people. We have been given greater controlling powers an can confiscate alcohol.

We talked to them about the amount they drink and we'll be submitting their drinking diaries to our resident GP on Friday's programme. watch our volunteers on a night out

What's the harm in binge drinking? If you take twice the recommended limit of alcohol units in a day, you're binge drinking, according to Professor Sir Michael Marmot, of University College London. For a woman, that's four glasses of wine in an evening - or two double vodkas. watch our interview with Sir Michael Marmot

Have things changed? We talked to journalist Eve Pollard and TV Presenter Sara Cawood about women's attitudes to alcohol watch our discussion with Eve Pollard and Sara Cawood

Wednesday: men behaving badly Alcohol plays a large part in violence and anti-social behaviour in many city centres. Breakfast was in Manchester to find out what's being done to tackle the problem. Our reporter Mike Sergeant was at Sinclair's - a pub which won the police's best pub award for providing a safe environment to drink. Mike talked to Darren Coles, Sinclair's pub landlord , and to Sgt. Jan Brown. Darren Coles said the onus is on the pub staff to tell customers nicely that they've had enough: drinking has changed, people are drinking more to cope with stresses of life. Binge drinking tends to occur on Fridays when people want to let their hair down. We don't allow glasses outside the pub and we will tell people to go home, if they have had too much to drink.

Sgt Jan Brown said alcohol consumption has gone up: We are dealing with the increased facilities for alcohol by developing a partnership with A&E departments, pubs, police and transport. We have tried to maximise the resources we have available. We recognised that there are more places for people to drink, and rise in alcohol crimes goes hand in hand. Having incentives such as the Good Pub Award can create a more responsible attitude.

Thursday: alcoholism The NHS spends around £1.7bn treating the effects of alcohol each year - from victims of violence, to detoxing alcoholics. But does the treatment available for alcoholics really work?

We heard the story of one man, Martin Saunders, who's a recovering alcoholic. ""I ended up in a psychiatric hospital on suicide watch,"" he told us. Eventually, he decided that drink was at the root of his problems - and he had to detox: ""I was flat on my back in hospital two days and gradually got back to walking and talking. In fact, it was some while before I felt well enough to walk. hear Martin's story in his own words

We also heard from the family of one woman - a successful and popular solicitor - who died from the effects of alcohol at the age of 39. Julia's sister Leonora died at 39 while waiting for a liver transplant Leonora's family had no idea that she had a drink problem until 1998. In fact, she was drinking up to three bottles of wine and champagne a day. Despite joining Alcoholics Anonymous, she simply couldn't stop - and eventually, in 2003, Leonora died while awaiting a liver transplant. Her sister is raising money for a treatment centre in her name - the Leonora Trust If you'd like to donate, the address is: The Leonora Trust, PO Box 5539, Northamptonshire NN6 6ZL. Or you can email julia.kawecki@tesco.net watch our interview with Leonora's sister, Julia

Friday: practical steps Our guests consumed 70 units in a week Breakfast's regular GP Dr Rosemary Leonard offered some no-nonsense advice on drinking safely. We met our three drinkers from earlier in the week - Katie, Lucy and Kelly -they had been keeping a drink diary and we discovered that between them they had consumed 70 units of alcohol. This was 30 units more than the recommended safe limit. Dr Rosemary stressed the importance of making sure the women had at least one or two days a week when they didn't drink at all. Click here to see that item Know your limits To drink safely, you should consume no more than 14 standard units of alcohol per week if you're a woman - or 21 if you're a man. Many people are confused about what that means in practice. A standard unit is - a small glass of wine; one half a pint of normal strength beer; or one single pub measure of spirits. Using this measure, there are probably eight standard units in a bottle of wine - although some New World varieties and dessert wines may be much stronger. Export beers and premium lagers are also much stronger than standard British bitter. And almost any shot of spirits poured at home is likely to be larger than a single pub measure. So, it's very easy to clock up far more than your weekly intake, without really noticing.

Calling on God to tackle addiction,,['Clare Murphy'],2004-03-09 10:27:25,"By Clare Murphy

BBC News Online



In the run-up to this year's presidential election, a $100m voucher programme is to be rolled out in the US which would allow addicts to buy places on some of the nation's most controversial faith-based drug programmes.

Teen Challenge says religion is key to its success

US President George Bush may be at odds with the revolutionary philosopher on most issues, but both would concur on the power of religion and its heady effects.

The patch of common ground would however be a small one. Mr Marx was keen that people throw off what he saw as the shackles of faith, and embrace not drugs but revolution.

Mr Bush, who himself gave up drinking with the assistance of faith, is hoping to harness the potential of religious belief to help American drug addicts kick their habit.

To its critics, the faith-based programmes are an underhand way of breaking down the constitutional barrier between church and state through the indirect federal funding of religious groups, and one which will leave vulnerable individuals open to state-sponsored proselytising with no proven benefits in terms of reducing drug addiction.

But to its advocates, the new system can only benefit the nation's estimated 14 million drug users, giving them access to a vast range of programmes and techniques - both faith-based and secular.

Boot camp

The success, or otherwise, of Christian and other faith groups in weaning their charges of drugs is largely anecdotal. To their supporters, they work. To their detractors, they do not; neither side has much empirical evidence to support their claims.

However the track record of Alcoholics Anonymous is frequently called upon as an example of the beneficial role faith can play in treating addictions.

It is the belief in something larger than oneself that helps them kick the habit... and it is the faith they acquire during their time with us that stops them descending back into their addiction leave

Dennis Griffith

Teen Challenge graduate

Dennis Griffith is a graduate of Teen Challenge - an evangelical Christian drug treatment programme which stands to benefit from the voucher system. He now runs the California branch of the programme, the main component of which is bible study and prayer.

""It is the belief in something larger than oneself that helps them kick the habit when they are here, and it is the faith they acquire during their time with us that stops them descending back into their addiction when they leave,"" he says.

""We insist that they find a church to attend in the area they return to, firstly so they can nurture their faith, but also so that they can slip into a readymade community. Loneliness can be a one-way ticket back to where they came from.""

When people with addiction problems seek government help, they should receive medical treatment and support services, not sermons and scriptures

Reverend Barry Lynn

""I thought it sounded dumb at first. I wasn't in the least religious and was very dubious. But I was desperate - I knew I was about to lose everything. I phoned - spoke to a guy at the end of the line - and for the first time in years I felt a spark of hope, that this might be a turning point.""

Teen Challenge has elements of the boot camp. The week lasts seven days, kicking off at 6:30am each morning with a chapel service, which is followed by classes - most of them involving bible study and discussion of how religious teachings can be applied to everyday life.

It claims a success rate as high as 86% - although this figure only takes into account those who complete the programme. Many do not.

""Ideally we want people to come to us of their own accord. The programme is most effective when participants actually want to be there. That's why we would happily work with the voucher system - the addicts themselves would be choosing our programme rather than it being foisted upon them.""

Keeping the faith

The prospect of an organisation like Teen Challenge receiving federal assistance is welcomed by some advocacy workers.

At present, one in five American addicts gets no help. We know that some of these programmes work, so it doesn't make any sense to shut them out when people need them

Jenny Collier

Legal Action Center

""At present, one in five American addicts gets no help. We know that some of these programmes work, so it doesn't make any sense to shut them out when people need them,"" says Jenny Collier, director of national policy and state strategy for the Legal Action Center.

""$100 million may not seem a lot, but given that we've currently got a budget deficit and most programmes are having their funding slashed, it displays a real commitment on the part of this administration to helping addicts. That's very encouraging from our point of view.""

During his four years in office, President Bush has worked hard to further involve religious groups in the provision of welfare across a broad range of services.

Many members of the administration are convinced that religious groups provide a service that can compete with or improve on secular state provisions.

Mixed results

The involvement of religious bodies in welfare is not new as such. But theoretically at least, under previous practice, groups have only been able to claim federal money for services which are secular in nature, in keeping with the constitution.

The voucher system would allow them to keep the religious aspect as the central plank of their programme, which must be approved by the state. For the politicians who favour these groups, such a caveat is essential if the programme is to retain the very element which makes it attractive to them in the first place.

But research is still being carried out to establish whether the assumption of efficacy in the case of faith-based welfare provision is a sound one.

Preliminary results from the first academic study comparing secular providers of social services with faith-based ones - in this case those providing job training - suggested the religious-oriented groups were not performing as well.

However, for some US campaigners, the issue at stake is not so much their effectiveness but what they see as the blurring of the division between Church and State, a line which they argue has down the centuries allowed American churches to flourish free of political interference and government to operate without religious bias.

""The president is trying to blast a huge hole in the wall of separation,"" declares Reverend Barry Lynn, head of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""In America, houses of worship are perfectly free to evangelise, but they should do so with their own funds, not money from the taxpayer.

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.","['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Reporter']",None,"Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.

Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.

He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"".

Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.

It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives.

Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail

""I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges.

But he has a different perspective: ""I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems.

""I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well.

""We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there.""

This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with.""

So, who is the real John McAfee?

To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.

Addicted and expelled

Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II.

When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head John McAfee

""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""There's not much difference between our countries.""

They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.

That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.

They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions.

Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June

""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation.

""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time.""

Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software

Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help.

""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says.

""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world.

""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall.""

Anti-virus millionaire

Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.

There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""

""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McAfee speaks to Leo Kelion about his life and why he fled from the police in Belize

He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.

The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn).

""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain John McAfee

""It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things.

""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could.""

Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name.

""I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection.

""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus.

""Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there.

""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email.

""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software.""

Image caption John McAfee says he has not taken drugs or drunk alcohol for nearly three decades

After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.

Then he headed south.

Research and raid

In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection.

""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other.

""Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics.""

He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.

Things didn't go as planned.

The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.

Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.

Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.

In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.

McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.

They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges.

""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states.

""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing.

Image caption McAfee's Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belize's jungles

""It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place.

""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not.

""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound.""

McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.

The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry.

""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee.

""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive.""

Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro

At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day.

""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize.

""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me.""

She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age.

""He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK.

I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist

""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age.

""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened.""

McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.

One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.

He continued the relationship.

""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains.

""Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues.

""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child.

Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island

""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description.

""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her.

""All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?""

Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy.

""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says.

""And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out.""

Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year

Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.

There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life.

""I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says.

""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives.

""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all.

""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John.""

Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.

'Hatchet buried'

On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.

Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more.""

That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.

Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.

Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize

The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.

An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.

McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.

He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says.

""The government does from time to time.

""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man.

""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so.""

McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla.

""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says.

""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody.

""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that.""

Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises

In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.

It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance.

""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this.

""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer.""

Hiding out

McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail.

It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught.

Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee

""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls.

""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair.

""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that.""

Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"".

""I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added.

Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfee's claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs.

During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller.

""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls.

""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me.""

She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.

The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.

In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data.

""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee.

""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment.""

A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man.

""After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'"" he says.

""But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred.""

Hero and villain

McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.

The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.

A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman.

""Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC.

""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize.""

So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says.

""Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent.""

That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.

In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.

He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.

While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net.

""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains.

He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.

He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.

Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.

He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.

He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts.

""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says.

Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?

At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.","['john', 'mcafee', 'came', 'im', 'runaway', 'later', 'belize', 'coder', 'caption', 'head', 'addict', 'mcafees', 'going']","Who is the real John McAfee?

Seeing in 2000 with a glass of orange juice,,[],1999-05-11 11:34:49,"Clusters of other non-drinkers will also see in the year 2000 with a clear head and no hangover, while much of the rest of the country staggers around, looking for someone else to kiss. And Clapton - unlike a lot of people - will also remember what the evening was like.





Crooked memories all many will have

Now he and his friends can celebrate without anyone trying to press a drink into their hands, free from anything making their abstinence harder than it already will be.

Sticking with friends

Nick Tegerdine, director of the Alcohol Problems Advisory Service in Nottingham, says he knows other groups of people who were in a similar position as Clapton, who were trying to make sure they would be able to enjoy the evening in ""a safe atmosphere"".

Most of these were so-called ""abstainers' circles"" - groups of friends who were organising parties in their homes, or in hotels where the bar would be shut or only serving soft drinks.





Meanwhile, other things will be going on

The real problems, he says, were for people who did not want to drink but were going out where other people would be.

""It's a difficult time because so many people think it's a time just for excess, a time to get staggeringly offensively drunk,"" he says.

This puts the onus on people who are hosting parties and on pubs to be responsible. Some pubs were offering ""Eat and drink all you can"" tickets for New Year's Eve for £150 each. This was, Mr Tegerdine says, very bad practice as it puts even more pressure on people to drink.

Staying ""on the wagon"" is no easy business. Just a flick through an average day's tabloids reveals a bevy of sports stars, TV actors or models who are battling the booze, or back with the bottle.

Big event

Yet however hard someone has fought against drink, staying away from the most long-awaited party is a high price to pay. But it's a price some will be keen to pay.

One recovering alcoholic, who asked not to be named, said the big events of Christmas and New Year often acted as a catalyst for people who realised they had problems with their drinking.

Like Clapton, he said, many members of Alcoholics Anonymous would be spending the New Year together.





The Trafalgar Square fountains, traditional focal point

""Whatever is going on in the world or the individual's life, it's down to that person to cope with.""

He said: ""If you had asked me 15 years ago what I would be doing at the end of this year, I would have said I'd be dancing in the fountain. Now I don't really think I'll be doing that. I'll be seeing it in with some friends, and God willing, I'll be sober.""

It is not just recovering alcoholics who may be concerned, though, said Mark Bennett, of Alcohol Concern.

""It can be very difficult, especially on celebratory occasions. New Year's is traditionally a wet event, and I suspect the Millennium will be wetter than most.





One way many will choose to spend the night...

For those unwilling or unable to take Clapton's lead, there are a number of practical steps they can take.

Mr Bennett says: ""If you are going out, make sure the people you go with know you are not going to drink. That way they don't spend all evening trying to persuade you to have one, and you don't have to spend all evening refusing.

""Also try not to get involved in buying rounds - people tend to feel they ought to buy you an alcoholic drink rather than what you want,"" he said.

Mr Tegerdine says a tip which worked for many people was practising saying no to a drink in front of a mirror.





...a way others will choose

Stock responses to offers of drinks also worked, he said. Things like ""Ayatollah's orders"", or blaming medicine, helped to get people off your back.

Your name's not on the list?

And if none of this works, and an invitation to chez Clapton's is not forthcoming, then perhaps anyone wanting to avoid the bash should take a flight to Boston, US, and spend the night in the Waterbar.

Although its international selection of drinks have come from as far as Italy and Fiji, they have one thing in common.

They are all water.","['drink', 'spend', 'friends', 'juice', 'evening', 'glass', 'way', 'tegerdine', 'trying', 'seeing', 'ill', 'problems', 'orange', '2000', 'going']","This was, Mr Tegerdine says, very bad practice as it puts even more pressure on people to drink.

The monarchy: 1968 v 2007,,[],2007-11-27 13:31:25,"1968 was the first time the Windsors allowed the cameras in The new BBC documentary series on the monarchy comes nearly 40 years after the Royal Family first let the cameras into their home for a ground-breaking film about their lives. How do the two programmes compare? Two-thirds of the British population sat down in June 1969 to watch the BBC documentary Royal Family, the first in-depth look at the life of the Windsors. The camera crew had spent 12 months filming during the previous calendar year and such was its impact that the Queen saw no need to give a televised Christmas speech at the end of the year, issuing a written message instead. Publicity for Monarchy in 2007 was rather more eventful, engulfing the BBC in a storm when a trailer was edited out of sequence and shown to journalists. But putting that controversy aside, how did the first episode of the new series compare with the original? FRESH INSIGHTS 1968: Viewers of Royal Family were spoilt for choice at seeing the Windsors at ease - having a picnic, decorating the tree, watching television. But the sight of the Queen rummaging through her purse in a sweet shop near Balmoral, to buy bullseyes for six-year-old Prince Edward is one image that stays in the memory. Who said the monarch never carries cash? There is also a touching sequence - made so by the sensible absence of commentary - of Prince Philip taking young Edward rowing. 2007: There are few sights of the royals off-guard in the first episode but the Queen arrives for the infamous Annie Leibovitz photoshoot a little irritated. ""I'm not changing anything. I've done enough, dressing like this, thank-you very much."" Getting dressed into such an elaborate costume has been quite an ordeal and when Leibovitz suggests removing the crown, the Queen has a prickly response. Leibovitz says afterwards she admired her ""feistiness"" but she was clearly used to more malleable subjects. ROYALS ON TOUR 1968: The Queen and Prince Philip tour Brazil and Chile. At a football match in Rio they receive bemused applause. Brazil has ""90 million people who have scarcely heard of Britain and never seen a queen"", says the narrator. But the reception in Santiago is rapturous with crowds lining the streets and waving Union flags. The couple made 2,500 handshakes in 14 days and held 104 engagements. 2007: The state visit to the US provokes obsessive preparations on the part of their hosts. A hotel in Virginia installs a new toilet seat in the Queen's suite, where the linen has been washed four times and the tags removed from the towels. At the White House, every piece of chandelier crystal is polished. The crowds are full of praise for the Queen's longevity and grandeur. ""We have no palaces,"" said one. CHANGING TIMES

1968: Cost-cutting is nothing new to the monarchy. The film explains that the palace has recently undergone ""efficiency studies"" to trim finances. The splendid royal yacht Britannia is in service and there's a wonderful reference to the ship's company always wearing soft shoes on deck and using hand signals, to preserve the quiet below. Making a more general point, the film notes that ""the balance has shifted from armies to defend the Empire to exports to defend the pound"". 2007: The documentary opens with the Leibovitz photoshoot and narrator Tim Piggot-Smith says choosing a celebrity photographer to mark the state visit to the US suggests the monarchy is increasingly aware of the need for PR. ""Asking her to capture the Queen is positively daring and a sign of the Palace's growing media sophistication."" The Queen's visit to the US this time around is more inclusive than 50 years ago when there was segregation of blacks and whites, and native Americans could not participate. PRINCE PHILIP 1968: Prince Philip was displaying his unique brand of humour 40 years ago. ""What's the tie? Alcoholics Anonymous?"" he asks one decorated war veteran. Both at home and abroad, the film demonstrates the Duke of Edinburgh's and the Queen's knack for small talk, after 15 years of practice. 2007: The Duke of Edinburgh has lost none of his frankness and there is a difference of opinion between him and an expert on 17th Century American forts when the prince insists that horses roamed Virginia before the Spanish arrived. THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP 1968: Before being introduced to the Queen, the new American ambassador is drilled on how he should enter the room. One step forward, left leg first, then bow, he is instructed. He carries off the steps a little nervously but then becomes tongue-tied when asked by the Queen about where he is living. ""We're in embassy residence,"" he says, ""subject to some discomfiture as a result of the need for elements or refurbishing and rehabilitation."" Nerves can strike even the most senior diplomat. 2007: President George Bush appears relaxed at the set-piece speech, making a joke about ""the look only a mother could give"" when a slip of the tongue implies the Queen was at the 1776 celebrations. But away from the full glare of the cameras, he appears rather uncomfortable and leaves the small talk to wife Laura. Back-slapping intimacy is not an option with the Queen. But the bumpy ride he gives Gordon Brown on his golf buggy a couple of months later indicates there are other weapons in the president's social armoury deemed inappropriate for Queen Elizabeth II. QUEEN AND PRIME MINISTER 1968: Every Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Harold Wilson is driven 1,000 yards from Downing St to Buckingham Palace for a private audience with the Queen, just as Churchill, Disraeli and North did before him. ""It's the moment when democracy and monarchy meet,"" says Piggot-Smith. Wilson sensibly puts his pipe out before entering the palace and the Queen gives a beaming smile before asking him if he has been in the House today. The atmosphere seems relaxed before the meeting proceeds behind closed doors. 2007: Tony Blair makes an entrance that is almost a carbon copy of Wilson's, with the handshake, bow and address. They discuss the Queen's forthcoming visit to the US and there are no signs of awkwardness in front of the cameras. But they have had 10 years together in which to become familiar. In a moment that underlines her staggering breadth of experience during her reign, she notes to Blair about the trip: ""I did find myself saying to them [American officials] 'it's not new to us because we were there 50 years ago.'"" SPEECHES 1968: The Queen gives direct input into the wording of her speeches and changes parts that she thinks could be improved. Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart tells the programme it is important that her oratories must be relevant and not just platitudes, although they must avoid making political points. 2007: Forty years on, she is still meticulously checking and amending what she has to say, adding a mention of the Virginia Tech massacre to the speech she makes on arriving in the US. One of Stewart's successors Margaret Beckett is in tow, following a long tradition that foreign secretaries accompany state visits. FILM VIEWPOINT 1968: The documentary was broadcast at the time of the investiture of Prince Charles and the focus is very much on the heir to the throne. The opening sequence features him water skiing, fishing and cycling - this is an all-action prince. The film, which adopts a reverential tone, promises a look at the life the prince is to inherit. And he's still waiting... 2007: There is a distinct change of emphasis for the modern documentary. This time the Queen is centre-stage and the over-arching theme is her endurance in a changing world. There are one or two sceptical voices included but admiration and respect dominate the responses from high-profile contributors. A selection of your comments appears below. One thing that grated was the American insistence on referring to Her Majesty as the Queen of England....

Gina, Swindon It was a well-made documentary, thank-you BBC. It showed me the UTTER wrongness of a system that lowers everyone beneath a single family by accident of birth - a family whose interests and values don't represent mine in anyway whatsoever. In the interests of balance I expect a series on the republican struggle for democracy - the passionate struggle for all the people to be able to elect our head of state. And IF the PEOPLE choose Liz Windsor to represent us abroad then fine !

Carl Pierce, London, England The BBC spends too much time eulogising this archaic institution. Apart from that, I am an ardent admirer of the service offered by the BBC and valued it's reporting highly during long periods spent overseas. I remember waking up cheering in Tripoli, Libya, to a BBC overseas report of the Entebbe rescue by the Israeli airforce and commandoes.

Tony Burleton, London England It is sad to note that some people are so quick to criticise the monarchy. To the republicans, would you really want a President Blair or Brown? I think the Royal family is an exceptional vehicle for our country, and many others, both internally and internationally. There is no monarch, and perhaps individual, who is as widely recognised or universally respected as the Queen, and as her subjects we should be very proud. This is a feeling I believe was carried through in this programme.

Will, Devon The film was an exercise in prurient desire to peek into a forbidden world. This family is still German in attitude and surrounded by stuffy courtiers no mater how English their name change 90 years ago. Thr European Royals show ours the way to live in a modern world. If Diana had lived imagine how she would have changed them for the better

Jon, London My immediate though was ""when does she get a rest?"" as she seemed to be propelled from one event to the next with barely a second to relax. For an 81 year old I think it's quite a feat, and if I have half her energy at her age I'll be very happy.

Liz , London An interesting documentary. I don't think we learned anything especially new, but it did occur to me that there is a political benefit to having a monarch as head of state: the monarch is apolitical, she has no direct powers over the democratic process and provides a strong sense of stability, this is something a republic cannot have as the head of state can potentially change every four years.

Dan, Guildford UK I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary and the insight it gave into how our royal family are perceived abroad. The one criticism I have is that there were too many shots of the gardens, or buildings. We know what the Palace looks like I would prefer to see more interaction between the Queen and her officials.

Thomas Moseley, Ipswich Suffolk The BBC should learn a lesson from last night's documentary. It didn't need hype or spin - it was a fascinating programme.

Helen, Dorset The first film was wonderful and I have seen it several times. I watch every documentary about the Monarchy and thoroughly enjoy each one. I look forward to seeing this. If you have any doubts about people in USA wanting to see them - check on how many went to see the movie The Queen... and bought the DVD.

Cathy Hollowell, Houston, Texas, USA I thought it was a wonderful insight into the hard work and commitment Her Majesty has given the world and it makes me feel very proud to be one of her subjects. I will just say that I am not particularly proud of British history especially relating to the Empire and what 'we' did to achieve it and maintain it but in the world of terror, fear, hardship and suffering, it is good to see another side of our history portrayed in a way that gave a balanced view and showed just how much the Americans look to us. I thought Dubya looked a bit of a clown though, nothing we or the BBC did, just an honest portrayal!

Gary, Sunbury OK, another BBC production to help prop up this undemocratic, incredibly wealthy family, so now how about a series looking into the Republican movement and the advantages of a truly democratic system?

Richard Wells, Luxulyan Cornwall UK I wondered if the brand new towels and sheets were washed four times on orders of the Queen herself, her staff, or it was a decision made by the Americans? The film didn't make it clear whose instruction it was - but could imply that all her sheets and towels at home are always washed four times. In this age of worrying about the planet and green issues, that seems an appalling waste of water and energy.

Wendy, Rickmansworth ""...her endurance in a changing world."" Sounds about right, she is reminiscent of a time well gone, thankfully.

Stephen, Caerphilly

Corrie bosses say Curly's future is assured

Kevin Kennedy, Coronation Street's Curly Watts, has returned home after four weeks of treatment in a psychiatric hospital for his drink problem.

The 36-year-old actor was admitted to the private Priory hospital in Hale, Greater Manchester, on August 15, two weeks after publicly confessing his alcoholism.

Granada TV said he was ""feeling fit and well"" but would return to the hospital for counselling and meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.

It is not yet clear when Kennedy, who has been in the soap for 16 years, will return to work. He is due to meet producer David Hanson in the next few weeks to discuss Curly's comeback.

Kennedy's problems became public in June when he collapsed in the street near his home and spent a few days in hospital.

Soon afterwards, he checked into a rehabilitation clinic where he spent 11 days before leaving and holding an emotional news conference to admit his problem.

He said it was the death of his friend Kevin Lloyd - 'Tosh' Lines in police drama,The Bill - which made him confront his own alcoholism.

Carrey: clinched role Seuss-essfully

Jim Carrey will portray the havoc-wreaking Grinch in a big-budget, live action adaptation of the Dr Seuss classic, How the Grinch Stole Christmas - a role previously expected to go to Jack NIcholson.

Universal PIctures bought the rights to the story from Dr Seuss's widow for $5m in one of the largest book-to-movie deals in Hollywood history.

The film will be directed by Ron Howard, who has been a fan of the book since childhood. ""Grinch is a great character,"" he said. ""He's an anti-hero who winds up doing the right thing.""

Universal has also agreed to pay $4m for a second Seuss book, Oh, the Places You'll Go, and plans to capitalise on the Seuss name in its theme parks and merchandising businesses.

Cruise praises Kubrick's genius

Hollywood megastar, Tom Cruise, has broken the silence surrounding the filming of Stanley Kubrick's long-awaited Eyes Wide Shut, a tale of sexual obsession in which he stars with wife, Nicole Kidman.

Cruise insists the director was not indulgent, even though the film took 15 months to shoot.

""He doesn't waste time,"" said Cruise. ""He worked seven days a week. I got faxes from him at three and four in the morning with scenes.""

Cruise also described the director's extensive rewrites and last minute cast changes as simply ""part of the process.""

He said the notoriously perfectionist Kubrick was ""surprising but not pretentious. Suddenly he'll say something to you or you'll see how he creates a shot and you realise this man is different, this man is profound.""

Gathered no moss in Greece

Veteran rockers, the Rolling Stones have performed in Greece for the first time since 1967, when they were hustled off stage by military rulers.

More than 60,000 fans, including some top members of the government, welcomed back the Stones on the final leg of their Bridges to Babylon tour.

The mood was different from their last Greek gig, when lead singer Mike Jagger was dragged off stage for attempting to throw red flowers into the crowd - an action which police saw as a pro-Communist gesture.

Minelli hopes to perform with virtual reality mum

Liza Minelli and her stepfather, Sid Luft, have plans to team up and create a show about her mother, Judy Garland, featuring a hologram image of the late singer.

Luft's idea is for Minelli to sing with the virtual image of her mother at Radio City Music Hall in New York.

Minelli and Garland performed together only once during her lifetime in a show at the London Palladium in 1964.

Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm in July 1922 and made her showbiz debut at the age of two and a half. She died in 1969, barely two weeks after her 47th birthday.

What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.

The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Why's world shifted a few degrees on its axis.

It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world

His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11.

Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it.

The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country.

Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the day's events.

""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning.""

He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building.

A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door.

""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion.

""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that I'd never seen so much paper.

""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and that's when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing.

""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower.""

More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously.

His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family.

Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment

One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.

""I don't know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time.

""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream 'No, No, No!' at the thought that people were falling down. And that's when - I don't know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them.

I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!

""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didn't have a moment's thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking 'Can I help these people?' I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them.""

Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground.

""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground.

""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didn't see him hit.""

Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first.

Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground.

""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!'""

He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street.

Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood.

""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name.""

With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didn't look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him.""

An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine.

Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there.

When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing.

For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.

By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it.

In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on.

""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on.

""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

""I was feeling sadness and grief and mourning like I had never felt, similar to losing a loved one. And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened.""

He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem.

He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead.

Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood.

A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""I'm from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded.

His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway.

The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"".

In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience.

I was out of the country and didn't get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didn't fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it.

He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers.

Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles.

""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die.""

After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11.

He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years.

""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it.""

It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"".

Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003

""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people weren't doing that and moving on, it was like 'How can they be doing that?'

""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that 'OK, you don't need to talk about this any more.'""

Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions.

That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents.

""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do.""

He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go.

""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me.

""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home.""

Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents.

Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news

Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression

But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both

""We're so happy that he's moved because we became closer. It's a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help.""

""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So it's really helped me to know he's starting to come round.""

He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied.

After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama.

He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job.

As a young man, he'd had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"".

""I didn't know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before.""

When he arrived in 2003, he didn't have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through.

After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note.

Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted.

A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes.

""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero.""

In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade.

""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing.""

Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship.

""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. It's like I am stepping back into life. I'm finally moving past mourning.""

But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York.

'I witnessed the goodness of man' ""I don't believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyone's God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September

It's a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, I've been lucky to just get by.""

If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked.

""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone.

""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things I'm unable to do now.""

And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage.

""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. It's a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to.""

A siren is enough to take him back there and it's a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings don't instil in him the same fear they once did.

A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions.

He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims.

What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was

""They're not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, it's just bereaved family members.

""There's a sense that you don't count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people don't remember us.

""We're not suffering physically and weren't injured that day and didn't lose a family member. It's like we don't count.""

Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism.

""It's my life now and I've never accepted that before. That's another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but there's an acceptance, I'm moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again.""

It's comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold.

""I can't imagine a day going by when I don't think about it, even as a passing thought.

""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think I'm getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

On the trail of George Orwell’s outcasts,"Retracing Orwell's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty he identified - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were 80 years ago.","['Emma Jane Kirby', 'Bbc News', 'Paris']",None,"Image copyright Other Image caption Orwell's narration begins in the street he called the Rue du Coq d'Or, in the 5th Arrondissement, where he once lived

Some 80 years after George Orwell chronicled the lives of the hard-up and destitute in his book Down and Out in Paris and London, what has changed? Retracing the writer's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty identified by Orwell - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were then.

""Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing-orange-peel over the cobbles, and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse carts, made up the atmosphere of the street…. Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""

Image copyright bbc 'Tomber dans la misere' (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals Emma Jane Kirby

Such was George Orwell's recollection of what he called the Rue du Coq d'Or in Paris, 1929 - the real-life Rue du Pot de Fer. Today it's pleasure rather than poverty that defines the Latin Quarter that Orwell frequented 80-odd years ago. The chic pavement cafes are full of contented-looking people leisurely sipping their vin rose, and the air is perfumed by the sweet smell of crepes and tourists' money.

But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address. She may not look quite the same as she did in the 1920s but if Orwell were to meet her again on these streets, he'd know her straight away. And I doubt he'd find her greatly changed...

Poverty came knocking on Claudine's door five years ago when she was made redundant. She leans in close to me as she talks, her right hand often rising to her mouth as if it wants to censor the words that her lips keep forming. ""Tomber dans la misere"" (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals.

""We don't eat lunch,"" she tells me. ""It's just my little way of economising."" She nods down to her bulging shopping caddy. ""It's enough for my family's dinner,"" she says, ""but not enough for two meals a day.""

Shame

Claudine and I are sitting in a big warehouse in the north of Paris, which serves as a food distribution centre for the city's chronically poor. It reminds me of the sort of indoor market you find in the less salubrious quarters of former Soviet states - mountains of unbranded pasta and rice piled on tables, misshapen, anaemic-looking vegetables wilting in crates, biscuits and chocolate wrapped in such bland, stark white paper, that not even a child could be excited by its contents.

We watch the steady line of people, Europeans, Maghrebians and West Africans, methodically trudging from table to table, collecting their rations and stuffing them quickly into a pram hood or caddy. Despite the animated cheerfulness of the staff, I notice not one of the customers meets their eye as they take the food parcels.

Shame, Claudine - who is French - tells me, is what links everyone here. She's told no-one that her weekly shop is a hand-out and she doubts anyone else here has admitted it either.

The secrecy that's attached to poverty is one of the first things that struck Orwell.

""From the start,"" he wrote, ""it tangles you in a net of lies and even with the lies you can hardly manage it.""

Orwell the down and out Image copyright Getty Images Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs. He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933. In Paris, he washed dishes at the overpriced ""Hotel X"", in a filthy, hot kitchen. He met ""eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent"".

Milly is fighting poverty with a fierce, indignant energy. A bilingual secretary from Cameroon, she is immaculately dressed and has the practised deportment of a society debutante.

In the drop-in centre where I meet her, she looks decidedly out of place next to the dusty, weary figures that are slumped beside her. Appearances, she tells me, are everything if one is to cling on to one's dignity. She agrees to talk to me but only in a private room so that the other people here won't realise that her situation is as bad as theirs. When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Milly is facing deportation. She came here legally but after she fell ill and had to stop working, her carte de sejour - the papers that allow her to stay and work in France - were revoked. She admits that she is homesick but is terrified to return to Cameroon empty-handed. I ask her if her family know she's homeless and she throws her hands up in the air and rolls her eyes in horror.

""It would kill them,"" she tells me. ""They would drop down dead with shame.""

Aching all over

When I meet Modi from Mali, he looks as if he might drop down dead with fatigue. Like Orwell, Modi is a plongeur, a washer-upper in a big restaurant and he works six days a week, 12 hours a day cleaning pots and pans.

When we talk in the bar of a neighbouring restaurant, his head keeps drooping onto his folded arms and it seems to be such an effort for him to articulate his words that he either slurs them all together in a gluey, glottal jumble, or shoots out small phrases in tiny bursts of energy that fizzle out before the last word has been formed.

Orwell complained that when working as a plongeur he felt as if his back were broken and his head ""filled with hot cinders"". Modi agrees that he aches all over and at the end of the day he cannot feel his feet.

Because rent in Paris is too expensive, he lives an hour's train ride outside the city. Although after midnight the trains are slower so it takes two hours for Modi to get home. He gets up at 0700 and gets to bed at 0200. Most plongeurs in Paris these days are either Pakistani or West African. I stop asking myself why that is, when Modi tells me how much he is paid - just under 4 euros (£3.50) an hour. He's working, of course, ""on the black"".

""The last time I had a night out,"" he says flicking through a virtual diary in his brain, ""was... last year.""

Madame Jolivet can have as many nights out with friends as she wants to - her problem is she's not allowed to have any nights in with them.

Image copyright Other Image caption Madame Jolivet's tiny B&B room costs 1,730 euros a month

The rules of her B&B state clearly that visitors are not permitted, but I have managed to frighten the landlady into admitting me by pretending to be an official from the local authority. Now I'm standing (albeit slightly stooped) in her fusty-smelling attic apartment.

I am Madame Jolivet's first visitor in six years and she is laughing hysterically at having won this tiny victory over her hated landlady. I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache! Salope!"" (""Cow! Bitch!"") at their landlady, and Madame Jolivet doubles up with mirth as she mimes the insults at the sky-light. Then, quite suddenly, she looks sick with fear and switches the TV on at a high volume, motioning to the door and telling me the landlady is probably listening at it. She's right. We hear her tread softly back down the stairs.

Orwell's hotel room was infested with bugs - Madame Jolivet's is infested with mice. She's tormented by their scratching at night. She's caught them on camera during the day, and once she found one in her fridge. She complained to the landlady who warned her that if she mentions it again, she'll kick her out - after all, she's already been warned that her daughter's voice is too loud.

Madame Jolivet is a large lady and she squeezes herself round the tiny space of her apartment. When she's at the sink she's jammed between the bed and the table, her body painfully curved sideways to avoid smacking her head on the sloped ceiling. The landlady charges 1,730 euros (£1,500) a month for this space which she rents out as a 16 sq m apartment. Recently the police did a spot check on Madame Jolivet's apartment and recorded the actual habitable surface area as just 5 sq m - that's the size of about six or seven beach towels.

Madame Jolivet lives here with her grown-up son and daughter. Until last year her other daughter lived with them, too, but she tried to kill herself twice and is now in psychiatric care.

Although it's miles from the hostel where she's staying tonight, Milly, the dignified lady from Cameroon offers to come with me in the taxi to the Gare du Nord where I'm catching my train home to London to make my next step of Orwell's journey.

""In my country,"" she smiles, ""we never let a traveller start a journey alone.""

She's very jolly in the cab, reminiscing about her family, her sister in London, the present she sent her nephew in America last year. By the time we get to the Eurostar terminal I've completely forgotten that Milly's homeless and I realise with a real physical shock that this is exactly what she wanted, that she wanted me to see her as she was before poverty possessed her - a very proper, very animated, valuable woman.

She waves me off, her whole body swaying into the gesture, in that exaggerated way that small children say goodbye. Each time I turn, she's still there, both arms in the air, her head following the rhythm.

Sitting in my seat on the train, my eyes closed, I can see her still. The last line from a Stevie Smith poem comes into my head:

Not Waving but Drowning...

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell closely studied the tramps of London

""There exists in our minds,"" wrote Orwell, ""a sort of ideal or typical tramp - a repulsive, rather dangerous creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to beg, drink and rob hen-houses... I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life.""

Five minutes inside the soup-kitchen in Hackney, east London, and I immediately understand what Orwell meant - that the ""typical tramp"" does not exist.

The ""service-users"" - as the volunteers here call them - are a truly disparate group - some look as if they've just stepped off the tube after a busy day at work, others are unkempt and smell feral. Some are evidently fighting a losing battle with drugs and alcohol, while others look more in keeping with an old folks' home.

A well-spoken woman who is far more elegantly dressed than I am, and whom I take to be a doctor, confides in me her concerns about the well-being of a schizophrenic service-user she recently escorted to hospital. She then confounds me by sitting down to eat the free meal. A man with a carefully oiled black quiff is introduced to me by a grinning volunteer as Shakin' Stevens. I smile conspiratorially with him at Shaky's delusions and am later told by the service manager that the volunteer, himself, is delusional and has been coming here to eat each week for years.

Image copyright bbc Image caption Today's 'down and outs' are known as 'service-users'

Misfits

What was it that Orwell said? ""Change places and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?""

I am instantly struck by the civility of the meal time. A tattooed and very inebriated punk knocks over an elderly lady's walking frame as he staggers to find a free seat. He apologises, asks if the seat beside her is taken and then appears to engage her in polite conversation. When he is served a plate of Mediterranean vegetable pasta by the charming French chef, he thanks her profusely and leaning towards the Polish man opposite him asks if he would kindly pass the salt?

As I pour tea and coffee, an emaciated black man in a filthy sweatshirt shakes my hand warmly and asks me how I'm doing today? Society's misfits, fitting in.

So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk? Grant

It's here I meet Stuart, who is currently on a methadone programme and who has serious mental health problems. Physically abused by his father, Stuart was put into care in the North East of England, where he claims he was then systematically sexually abused until he gathered the courage to run away to London at the age of 15.

Aside from a brief respite of a year or two when he had a council flat, the London streets have been the only home he's known. He is now 40. I ask him to tell me what he remembers about those early years sleeping rough.

He doesn't miss a beat before replying, ""Crack, heroin, begging, robbing, stealing and mugging"". An entire life, reduced into just six words.

Grant on the other hand can talk the hind legs off a donkey but he prefers to steer clear of personal details, claiming there are many people worse off than him.

He zooms through his life story with a dismissive wave of his hand - adopted, never held down a relationship, used to work in social care, lost his job, lives in a hostel, spent a long time in hospital after being brutally attacked on the street.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell did the rounds of the night shelters and soup kitchens of London

He leaves out the part about his fairly evident problems with alcohol and when, three weeks into our acquaintance, I ask him about that side of his life he snarls defensively, ""So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk?""

Grant is articulate and funny. He's wary and prickly, yet sensitive and compassionate.

He likes Orwell but prefers Jack London. When my questions become woolly, he pulls me up for being unfocused and he is constantly re-assessing and re-evaluating his own beliefs and opinions. Twice after our meetings he has sent me text messages, apologising for sounding grumpy. When we talk late in the evening, he suddenly checks his watch and becomes concerned about how I'm going to get home to the other side of London. When I ask what keeps him going in life, he gestures towards the volunteers who are clearing up the kitchen.

""Belief in your fellow man's goodness,"" he says. ""Because by and large people are good, aren't they?""

Recession

Orwell always defended tramps' reputation as ""drunks"", pointing out that none of the tramps he knew had any money with which to buy beer. But today alcohol is cheap and features heavily in the lives of many of those on the streets. Not least in the lives of the many Poles who came to seek their fortunes as labourers in the UK when the borders opened in 2004.

When the recession bit and the building sites closed, they had limited access to benefits and quickly found themselves homeless. The volunteers in many of the drop-in centres and soup kitchens I visit in London tell me that around a good third or even half of their service-users are now Polish. As one careworker put it, they're ""Orwell's latter-day Irish tramp"" - Catholic, slightly on the fringe of the London homeless community, and plagued with a ""great thirst"".

London Image copyright Getty Images In London, the narrator lives as a tramp, stopping off in a variety of accommodation - lodging houses, tramps' hostels and Salvation Army shelters. He meets a number of characters, including Bozo, a pavement artist, storyteller and philosopher, who is adept in the technique of begging. One chapter is devoted to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang.

Zibbi, who's in his early 40s came to the UK seven years ago, where he got work in a salad factory in Peterborough. For nine months life was ""good-good"", he tells me in his broken English.

""Good-good, because Zibbi is good and Zibbi no drink.""

Zibbi refers to himself almost entirely in the third person, as if while talking to me, he has stepped outside of himself and has become a detached observer, albeit with an anthropological curiosity in his own behaviour.

""Do Zibbi drink today?"" he asks me.

By the look - and smell of Zibbi - he does little else but drink these days. His face has bloated and taken on the colour of ripe plums, his hands shake and the sharp stench of pure alcohol from his breath overpowers even the acrid, vinegary smell of his clothes and the odour of hot grease from his recent fried breakfast, which still hangs in fat little globules in his beard and moustache.

He shakes his head. ""Oh, lady,"" he says, ""Zibbi drink not a little drink, Zibbi drink and drink. He drink vodka til…"" (he makes a gesture of passing out). ""Until bang and bye bye. Game over.""

Zibbi blames the heavy drinking culture of his country for his weakness and claims his cousin, Miro, is the worst influence on him, egging him on to have just one more. Frequently he seems to set himself on stage, theatrically acting out imagined dialogue he has with Miro and with his disgusted family. It's like watching a medieval morality play, with the forces of Good and Evil battling for power.

I've thought about [my situation] so many times on the streets - especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless Mikael

The drop-in centre has set Zibbi up with an alcohol adviser who is trying to help him cut down his alcohol consumption. He talks about her in hallowed terms, and when he whispers her name ""Karen"", he lifts his hands and face to heaven. I suspect she's the only woman he has regular contact with. When I meet Karen later she tells me that she's trying to wean Zibbi off calling her ""Mummy"".

I ask Zibbi what he thinks of himself and he looks startled. ""Me? Zibbi?"" he asks uncertainly and his eyes become confused as if he's struggling to connect the alcoholic Zibbi character with the man who speaks his words.

""I… I… I don't know,"" he stutters. He hangs his head and slumps in his chair.

""So tired lady. I… I…""

'Not needed'

Zibbi becomes distressed as he fruitlessly searches for words which might join his isolated personal pronoun and we stop the interview. I realise he has totally lost his sense of self.

A few miles east in Hackney, and Mikael, a young, good-looking Pole in his late 20s, has also lost his identity - or at least his identity papers. Someone stole them one night a few months back when he'd blacked out in a vodka-induced stupor. Mikael is so softly spoken that he's barely audible at times. He tells me that talking to me is like going to Confession.

""I've thought about it [my situation] so many times on the streets,"" he says. ""Especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless.""

Mikael underestimates himself. A bright man and a fluent English speaker, he's enrolled in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme and, in a bid to stay on track, has made the very difficult decision to eschew the company of his fellow Poles and all other rough sleepers. He is still on the streets but unlike Zibbi, he is wearing freshly laundered clothes and looks fit and fairly healthy. He may not smell of alcohol but he reeks of loneliness.

Seven years ago, life was very different for Mikael. He had a legal, well-paid job as a labourer, he had a fiancee, a studio-flat and a gym membership. There were holidays, cinema trips, football matches - there was, as Mikael puts, it a time when he was ""really connected to society… and there was a future"". Then his boss sold his business and moved overseas. Mikael began drinking heavily, lost his studio and his girlfriend. I ask him what he misses most about his old life, fully expecting him to say the obvious things - a hot shower, a comfortable bed, his own food. But Mikael says something quite different.

""I feel like I'm not needed by this world. Like nobody needs me,"" he says quietly. ""I miss my girlfriend because I felt then someone needed me. And I felt needed in terms of work.""

The evil of poverty, wrote Orwell, is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. Work, he insisted, is the only thing to turn a half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being.

Mikael is desperate to find a job believing that work is the yellow brick road which will lead him ""to come back to the normal life,"" as he puts it. Although he admits that it's hard to keep motivated when you wake up cold, wet and shattered from a disturbed night in a shop doorway.

Mikael's progress is sporadic. He has long spells when he's free of alcohol and then sudden lapses which infuriate him and provoke tirades of self hatred, especially when he imagines what his family back home in Poland would say if they knew he was on the streets.

I return to the soup kitchen three weeks later confident of meeting Mikael again but worryingly, he doesn't turn up. I think of the boyish shyness which passed across his face when he had told me that sometimes when he was very lonely he talked to God. The prayer he recited was always the same:

""Hello God - I hope you still remember me and keep some faith in me.""

At the end of Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell asks himself what he's learnt from his experiences on the streets and in deference to the great man I shall ask myself the same question. I have learnt how quickly the dry rot of poverty stultifies and festers, crumbling confidence and destroying dignity.

I have seen how poverty marginalises, separates and ridicules. And I have understood that the chief cruelty of homelessness is that it doesn't dull the sensibilities of the man sleeping in the doorway but rather spitefully heightens them, forcing upon him so many cavernous hours in which he can burn with shame, ache with loneliness and cry for his mother.

Perhaps Mikael sums it up for everyone I have met both in Paris and London when he says, ""You know it's so easy to lose everything. But it's so, so tough to get it back.""","['outcasts', 'tells', 'london', 'orwells', 'poverty', 'im', 'mikael', 'george', 'zibbi', 'life', 'orwell', 'paris', 'shes', 'trail']","Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""
But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address.
He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933.
When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.
I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache!",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14372195,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/54426000/jpg/_54426100_orwellparis.jpg

How to survive the internet,,"['Janet Williams', 'In Seattle']",2002-03-26 08:37:03,"How to survive the internet



A counselling centre in the US is pioneering the treatment of people who just cannot stop browsing the internet Jessica Nicholas is a pretty, bright, outgoing 17-year-old, who enjoys singing, painting, sailing, swimming and hiking. But two years ago, the outside world hardly saw her at all. For between six and 20 hours a day, she sat in front of the computer. ""I stopped being an outgoing person,"" she says. ""Ironically, the friends who I was getting online to try to talk to were often out doing things. ""And I didn't do anything with them, because I was too busy being online, and hogging the phone lines that they were calling me on, to invite me places."" Her story is a familiar one to Dr Hilarie Cash and Jay Parker, who together have set up a counselling centre called Internet/Computer Addiction Services near Seattle, in the Pacific Northwest of the US. Online for 36 hours Jessica's problem appears mild compared with the extreme examples that have confronted Jay Parker. Click here to tell us if you are spending too much time online He has found that the online Multiple User Games, where players take on fantasy roles to compete against opponents logged on all over the world, are particularly addictive. ""I came across a young man who was in college. By the end of October, he stopped going to class. And by the first week in December, he had a psychotic breakdown after being online for 36 hours in a row, for sleep deprivation. ""I came across a young man who was in college. By the end of October, he stopped going to class. And by the first week in December, he had a psychotic breakdown after being online for 36 hours in a row, for sleep deprivation. ""If he started drinking alcoholically, it would take him more than that period of time to self-destruct. This happened so quickly. ""He dropped out of school in his last year, he had a relationship with a girlfriend and that went away, and he ends up in a psyche ward. It just devastated this guy."" Spotting the symptoms Many of us would admit to the occasional bleary-eyed internet-frenzy. But just how much is too much? ""It's rather like, how many beers do you have to drink to be an alcoholic? It's very ambiguous,"" says Mr Parker. ""That said, there are signs and symptoms. First of all, can somebody not accurately predict how much time they're going to spend online, prior to getting online? ""That said, there are signs and symptoms. First of all, can somebody not accurately predict how much time they're going to spend online, prior to getting online? ""And then, what pieces of your real life are going away, because of your behaviour?"" Those symptoms are becoming common. Dr Cash and Mr Parker estimate that up to 10% of all online Americans are addicted. For Dr Cash, the most worrying aspect of internet addiction is the vulnerability of children. ""Children seem to be very easily hooked into certain aspects, such as multi-user games and pornography. The younger the person, the more vulnerable they are."" She says schools and parents should wake up to the dangers. Supervision, says Dr Cash, is absolutely vital: ""We advise parents not to let their kids have internet access for hours on end in their rooms alone. ""It's very, very easy for them to be getting into trouble on the internet, and the parents to be oblivious to it."" Facing up to addiction For those who just cannot turn away from the computer screen, Mr Parker recommends the traditional 12-step model pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. The patient must acknowledge the addiction, and admit they cannot manage it on their own. Then they are linked to a support network, so that when they feel the urge to power up the computer, they can contact someone and talk it through.

I see people for real, instead of just seeing their little names show up on the computer screen

Jessica Nicholas Dr Cash says her approach is more ""cognitive behavioural"", in other words, helping people understand their thought patterns, and how to change them. Dr Cash says her approach is more ""cognitive behavioural"", in other words, helping people understand their thought patterns, and how to change them. ""The way you think is very strongly tied to the way you feel. So you can begin to change the way you feel about something, by changing the way you think about something. ""For instance, in the case of addiction, handling the urge to go online. If you think about that urge as something which is definitely going to overwhelm you, then you are going to give into the urge,"" says Dr Cash. ""But if you think instead, 'if I just sit here quietly and experience it, it will pass, and I will not have acted on it, and when it passes I will be fine again', you have replaced the old thought with a new thought. ""And if you say that enough times to yourself, it becomes a habit of thought."" Both counsellors stress that they're not recommending that anyone retire the computer and resort to pen and paper. ""The computer's here to stay, it's part of our life and definitely part of our future. It's really about creating healthy boundaries, a healthy balance,"" says Mr Parker. An hour a day Jessica Nicholas tried the approach, with the help of Dr Cash and her parents, and it did help. But for a while she chose to go ""cold turkey"", avoiding the computer altogether. Now, she is back online, but for just an hour a day. ""At first, I really didn't know what to do with myself. I suddenly had seven hours every night I didn't know were there. ""And I could do homework, and I could talk to people, and see people for real, instead of just seeing their little names show up on the computer screen. It was pretty neat!"" she says.

My flatmate is very much an internet junkie. He gets home from work at 6pm, logs on, and then starts playing online games until he goes to bed at 1am.

Ben, UK This article is bang on. I wasted three years at college loafing around on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and playing Quake. Programs like ICQ and MSN Messenger mean that you can build up a list of 'buddies' that is far more expansive and, often, more receptive, than real-world friends. It's a really self-destructive cycle.

It's a really self-destructive cycle. My flatmate is very much an internet junkie. He gets home from work at 6pm, logs on, and then starts playing online games until he goes to bed at 1am. He lives in a diet of coke and noodles, and they are the sole reason he will venture out from his darkened pit a couple of times a night. It's quite funny but at the same time a little worrying. Then there's his expensive habit of destroying joysticks when he loses.

Ben, UK Yup, I'm addicted. and I blame the BBC website for having so much interesting content

Seth Black, UK Definitely! I think at some stage I have been addicted.Many have been the times when I have been ""just checking e-mail"" or ""just surfing a few sites that I regularly use"", which turn into three to seven hours of seeming non-productive time sat in front of a screen. My main vice is gaming, the game in question Quake III. I have in the past played for eight hours non stop and gone for 24 hours without sleep. My wife frequently berates me when I seem to completely ignore her because I'm so intently concentrated.

Jon, UK Hmmm, sitting in front of a computer screen for seven hours a night. A lot of people sit in front of their TV's for similar amounts of time. Is this not just as bad (if not worse - there's absolutely no interactivity)? I don't have a TV and experienced similar feelings of 'wow! suddenly all this time to actually do real things in' when I first went TV-less. Personally I think it to be far healthier to be surfing the internet for hours than mindlessly drooling in front of the one-eyed god.

Sam, UK

If I spend hours on the phone to friends and family, I'm seen as sociable and caring. If I spend those hours e-mailing the same people, or chatting to them on IRC, I'm a geek who's out of touch with ""real life""

Janet, UK It is a little debatable as to whether I'm spending ""too much time"". With ADSL and working from home, I have the US radio services via the internet and listen to items I've missed from BBC Radio 4, and do spend a lot of time at the screen, keeping up to date with information technology as well as seeking items to buy, checking e-mail, responding to clients etc. My online presence is often 16 hours plus a day but I do watch some TV and go out shopping.

Yes, I use the internet, but I can happily live without it. I just wish this was the case with my wife. When she gets in from work, the PC goes on and it can be 5 or more hours before she logs off. At the same time the mobile phone is constantly going as she talks to people she's having an online conversation. It's not uncommon for her to be talking to one person about three different things in three different chat rooms. Our marriage is suffering as a result, as is her relationship with her son. But how do you get someone to acknowledge it as a problem? If I mention it to my wife, she becomes very aggressive and defensive, so how can I help her?

Iain, England If I spend hours on the phone to friends and family, I'm seen as sociable and caring. If I spend those hours e-mailing the same people, or chatting to them on IRC, I'm a geek who's out of touch with ""real life"". Surely in this technologically advanced age we should be putting such irrational prejudices behind us and learning to value communication in all its forms?

Janet, UK My ex was a net addict - that's why we split up.

Tom, UK At the moment, as sad as it seems I cannot see myself living without the internet. When I get home from school at 4pm I instantly head towards the computer and I will sit there just generally chatting to people until about 1am most nights. My relationship with friends is suffering as I no longer seem up for going out, I seem more interested in words on a screen then real people. It's pathetic, I know it is. But I can't seem to break off the habit. I find the internet just depresses me, I want my own real life back again!

Laura, UK All things in moderation. The great pitfalls of western society have traditionally been sex, drugs, rock and roll. Now we get to add the internet. People are lost to vices because they behave immoderately.

Colin Butts, USA To Sam UK - Surely there is not much difference in watching the TV for hours and being online for hours. Both fry your brain and render you a bore up the pub. I have a TV and a computer but when watching TV I tend to sit over 6 feet away from it rather than 1 foot like you do with a computer, which is surely bad for your eyes and grey matter. Let's all go for a walk in a field instead.

Ruby Wax is 'Losing it' at the Edinburgh Fringe,Comedian Ruby Wax's Edinburgh Fringe show looks for laughs in the story of her mental illness.,"['Steven Brocklehurst', 'Bbc Scotland News Website']",None,"Image caption Ruby Wax has been touring the show around psychiatric hospitals

Ruby Wax is mentally ill.

""But at least I got a show out of it,"" she tells the audience with her trademark glibness.

Losing it, playing at the Underbelly during the Edinburgh Fringe, is Wax's examination of her own breakdown and her thoughts on what led her to it.

The 58-year-old maintains the hyperactive, self-centred, wisecracking persona which she developed over three decades in the spotlight but there is also a more honest and vulnerable Wax telling a personal story.

Wax shares the details of her own clinical depression and her trips to the Priory and confronts the stigma and shame of mental illness.

""The show is comedy,"" she says.

""It is hilarious. I don't talk about raising awareness but at one point I see the audience start nodding their heads and they are saying 'I got that too'.

""But you don't have to be mentally ill to get what I'm talking about.""

""I have always been interested in psychology,"" Wax says.

She studied the subject at the University of California at Berkeley before running away to Glasgow to study acting.

""Acting became a job and I always said 'at some time I am going to go back and study this'.""

It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil Ruby Wax

She is currently studying for a Masters degree in ""mindfulness-based cognitive therapy"" at Oxford.

Wax says that understanding the way the brain functions takes the fear away.

""It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil,"" she says.

During the show, she delivers a cod-lecture on the science of the brain.

Careful not to be too serious, she steers away from neuroscience but her message is clear.

""Mental illness is a disease like diabetes, it cannot just be wished away.""

Wax has been performing the show, alongside her friend Judith Owen, for more than a year in hospitals and psychiatric units.

She says performing in psychiatric hospitals is the ""biggest thrill"" but she wants to reach out to the ""lost tribe"" of sufferers and carers.

'Got it made'

""My people,"" as she calls them.

Wax and Owen, who plays piano and sings snatches of songs which try to encapsulate the feelings the comedian is describing, will take the show to London's West End after its Edinburgh run.

Wherever they go they hold forums which discuss mental health issues such as the effectiveness of drugs and also seek to put people in touch with help and support.

Later in the year, Wax will unveil a website called blackdogtribe.com.

Wax says the website will have chat rooms and it will be very visual because much of the mental health literature can be very hard to read.

She hopes it will create a mental health brand which is something like Alcoholic Anonymous, where people form a network of support for each other.

""Those alcoholics have got it made,"" she quips.

Faces of the week,,[],2004-09-24 16:01:00,"

Our regular look at some of the faces which have made the news this week. Above are Lucy Ferry (main picture), with DAN RATHER, GRAHAM GREENE, PAT FINUCANE and BRIAN CLOUGH. Lucy Ferry

""If the law is an ass, people have the right to protest"", says Lucy Ferry, having just been fined for wilful obstruction during last week's anti-hunting protest. The 44-year-old Ms Ferry, ex-wife of rock star Bryan, was caught in a traffic jam on her way to Parliament Square, stopped at some traffic lights, got out of the car, locked it and walked away. Unfortunately for her, she didn't see the police van right behind her. Not long afterwards, her eldest son Otis was one of five protesters who invaded the House of Commons, an action of which his mother heartily approved. Lucy Ferry (left) after her court appearance this week Lucy Ferry is a fully paid-up member of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. The convent-educated daughter of a bloodstock agent and Lloyd's Insurance broker, she has been chasing foxes since the age of 12 and keeps her own hunter in Shropshire where Otis is master of foxhounds. She has three other sons by Bryan Ferry, the second of whom, Isaac, was once suspended from Eton for sending abusive e-mails to an anti-hunting campaigner. That Bryan was a working-class boy from the North East raised a few eyebrows when the couple married in 1982. She was the beautiful, 21 year-old aristocratic model, Lucy Helmore, 14 years his junior. He was the elegant singer with the lounge-lizard looks, riding high with his band Roxy Music. Lucy adorns one of their albums, Avalon. It was never an easy marriage. At its start, she helped him fight cocaine addiction by bringing stability to his life. While she was well known as a socialite, he was a shy workaholic suffering from manic depression. Fashion influence ""If you're married to an artist,"" she has said, ""their creativity always has to come first."" It was Lucy whose interest in astrology is credited with inspiring the album Horoscope, and she is also said to have persuaded Bryan to return to singing cover versions for the album Taxi. She was making an impact on the fashion world too, beyond her modelling assignments. Designers such as Christian Lacroix, Manolo Blahnik and Philip Treacy have cited her as an influence on their work. Bryan Ferry divorced Lucy in 2003 In the meantime, she was having to take the lion's share of rearing her four sons. ""It's always hard for a woman to bring up a family. It can be quite a lonely, isolated thing,"" she said. The pressure mounted, and in 1994 she admitted attending Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous. A dramatic incident triggered the end of her marriage. In 2000 the whole Ferry family were on a British Airways flight to Nairobi when a deranged passenger forced his way into the cockpit, attacked the pilot and caused the plane to lurch downward. A crash was only prevented when the assailant was eventually overcome. ""It was a moment when I reassessed my life,"" Lucy said. The divorce came soon afterwards on the grounds of her adultery, following a brief affair. A decade out of the showbiz limelight, the woman who once adorned the best-dressed women's lists is now mostly to be seen in jeans and jumper. To fellow members of her country set, the Ferrys have become champions; to the anti-hunting groups they are ogres. Lucy Ferry believes the government has mounted an attack not just on hunting but on a whole way of life, and sounds this warning. ""If Tony Blair thinks country people are going to give in quietly, then he has gravely misjudged."" Dan Rather

CBS anchor-man Dan Rather has apologised after documents which purported to cast doubt upon President George W Bush's military record were themselves shown to be questionable. The memos purportedly showed that Bush had been suspended from flying for the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam war because he failed to meet its standards. However, a source for the 60 Minutes programme admitted misleading the producer by giving a false account of the documents' origins.

Full story Graham Greene

London's British Library is mounting a revealing exhibition on the life of the reclusive novelist, Graham Greene. Greene, who would have been 100 this year, was the author of books including Our Man in Havana and The Quiet American, but the exhibition, Beyond the Novels, examines Greene's journalism and theatrical work. Exhibits include a letter from Greene to Sir Ralph Richardson in which the actor is accused of selfishness, vanity and an inability to learn his lines. Pat Finucane

The UK government has given the go-ahead for a judicial inquiry into events surrounding the 1989 murder of Northern Ireland solicitor Pat Finucane. Ministers confirmed that new legislation would be introduced allowing an inquiry into allegations that rogue members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army intelligence colluded with loyalists in the killing. Mr Finucane was shot dead in front of his family by loyalist Ulster Defence Association gunmen in his north Belfast home.

Full story Brian Clough

Brian Clough, whose Nottingham Forest team twice won the European Cup, has died at the age of 69. Clough, once called ""the best manager England never had"", was a flamboyant and outspoken figure. A former striker, he moved into management after badly damaging his knee. Beyond his European success, he led both Forest and Derby County to the League Championship and once quipped, ""I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business. But I was in the top one"".

Drink led man to New Year murder,,[],2005-07-12 16:21:03,"Pluck was sentenced to life by the High Court in Edinburgh

Edward Pluck, 39, stabbed Joseph Inglis to death and attempted to murder Brian Mowat at the celebration in Newlands Road, Glasgow, on 1 January this year.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard Pluck had been largely sober for eight years after years of alcohol abuse.

Pluck was also ordered to serve eight years for attempted murder to run alongside his life sentence.

The Barlinnie prisoner had earlier been convicted at the High Court in Glasgow of murdering Mr Inglis, 45, after he stabbed him and hit him over the head with a hammer.

These were violent attacks with weapons on two individuals

Lord Kinclaven

High Court judge

He then attacked his friend Mr Mowat, whom he also hit over the head, leaving him with impaired vision.

The jury at the Glasgow trial was played a 999 tape where the sound of the hammer blows could be heard as Pluck shouted: ""I'll smash this off your head.""

The court heard how Pluck had been invited to the flat for a drink by Mr Mowat as it was New Year's Eve.

Defence counsel Norman Ritchie QC explained how he had decided to go to have ""a couple of beers to bring in the New Year"" and ended up drinking much more.

'Occasional relapses'

Jurors also heard how Pluck had been attending Alcoholic Anonymous to cope with his alcohol problems but had suffered ""occasional relapses"".

Mr Ritchie said Pluck could remember little of his crimes and expressed his remorse over the attacks.

Lord Kinclaven ordered Pluck to serve 13 years before he could apply for release.

The judge added: ""These were violent attacks with weapons on two individuals.

Intoxication 'rife among doctors',,[],2005-06-13 12:33:42,"Last Updated: Monday, 13 June 2005, 12:33 GMT 13:33 UK E-mail this to a friend Printable version Intoxication 'rife among doctors' Dr Thomas Kenny is a recovering alcoholic The British Medical Association has called for action over alcohol and drug abuse among medics after a BBC survey showed the problem was widespread. BBC One's Real Story found over the last 10 years 750 hospital staff in England had been disciplined over alcohol and drug-related incidents. The BMA estimates one in 15 medics have a problem with drugs or alcohol at some point in their life-time. Ethics Committee chairman Michael Wilks said the profession was in denial. REAL STORY: Your life in their boozy hands - BBC ONE, Monday 13 June, 1900 BST Doctors are known to be at least three times as likely to have cirrhosis of the liver - a sign of alcohol damage - than the rest of the population. This is second only to publicans and bar staff. You've got a profession that doesn't want to face up to the fact that it's got a problem

Dr Michael Wilks

'I was an alcoholic doctor' Dr Wilks said: ""You've got a profession that doesn't want to face up to the fact that it's got a problem in the ranks. ""You've got levels of denial that make it virtually impossible for an alcoholic doctor to be helped. ""With a fairly modest investment we could set up a programme that could intervene effectively, train people to buy the right treatment and set up a monitoring system,"" he said. He estimates this would cost government £10million and would save money in the long run. The figures The BBC figures are based on replies from one in three hospital trusts in the UK and reflect only those cases that the employers knew about. NHS Employers said the figures were probably an underestimate. At Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, three consultants in three years had been referred to the General Medical Council for alcohol problems. At East Kent NHS Trust, seven doctors and two nurses had been disciplined over drink and drugs in the last 10 years. The biggest figure came from the University of Leicester NHS Trust where 17 clinical staff, including one consultant, four nurses and two operating theatre practitioners were disciplined over the past decade. The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons said a survey of 150 consultant surgeons revealed more than a fifth said they knew a colleague who they believed to be impaired by alcohol while on call. Patients have suffered and it's something I have to put up with every day of my life

Dr Thomas Kenny

Recovering alcoholic

Send us your comments Yet unlike other professions responsible for public safety, such as airline pilots and tube drivers, the NHS does not have strict rules on drinking before duty. Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Trust has guidance that staff should not drink up to eight hours before they are on duty. None of the others in the BBC survey had such rules. Alistair Henderson, director of operations for NHS Employers, said even when policy was in place it did not always safeguard against the problem. ""Sometimes it is easy to assume that having a policy is the same as dealing with it. ""I would hope and expect that all organisations are able to deal effectively with drug and alcohol abuse."" He said random alcohol and drugs testing of staff, which has been suggested by some as a solution, would not solve the problem. Dr Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's Head of Science and Ethics, said: ""Doctors respond extremely well to treatment when they have the appropriate services available to them. Research has shown that the vast majority of doctors will make a full recovery."" She also called for more government investment for such services. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We expect all NHS Trusts to have in place drug and alcohol misuse policies."" She added that all trusts were required to provide access to occupational health services for staff and that NHS Employers had made good progress to ensure staff were being provided with appropriate support. The Medical Defence Union, which provides medico-legal support and advice to UK doctors, said those with drug and alcohol problems should seek help early. Dr Thomas Kenny, a surgeon who is recovering from alcohol addiction, said: ""Patients have suffered and it's something I have to put up with every day of my life."" Natasza Lambert from Folkestone told Real Story she had been seen by a doctor who was under the influence of alcohol. ""He had come in straight from riding. He was absolutely paralytic. He was all over the place, stuttering and slurring."" Real Story: - BBC ONE, Monday 13 June, 2005 at 19OO BST. This debate is now closed. Thank you for your comments. Your comments: People are forever trying to blame their own failings on their circumstances, but that simply won't wash. Medical students and doctors knew what they were signing up for when they chose a career in medicine. They knew it would be stressful. They knew it would involve long hours and difficult decisions; but since when has alcohol solved anyone's problems or enhanced their ability to cope with stress? It never has and it never will. It causes only problems. More to the point, when the health and lives of patients is put at risk by the irresponsible behaviour of those who are supposed to be health 'professionals' clearly some action needs to be taken.

Medical student, Norwich, England I know many doctors and come from a medical background and this is not at all surprising. What is however a surprise is the lack of help that is out there for these doctors. The GMC would rather wash their hands of them which inadvertently makes the situation worse and the doctor is hence caught in a Catch 22 situation. One of my friends was actually reported to the GMC not that he ever came to work drunk or anything but had taken days off. Instead of getting proper help with his alcohol problems the GMC preferred to put restrictions on him which inherently made it impossible for him to get a job. I find it unbelievable that a profession which is supposed to be looking after the welfare of others cannot look after their own members.

Anon, London Doctor's have never had it so easy! In this part of the world they barely work a 9-5 Mon-Fri shift (much less than most people), they refuse to do out of hours work and still demand large salaries from the taxpayer. A few weeks ago a tourist died in our village because no doctor could be found on a Thursday afternoon, a very sad situation. Doctor's are becoming over pampered - this is a 24/7 world and doctors should have to work like the rest of us. It might keep them away from the booze, drugs and golf courses!

John MacDougall, Loch Tay, Scotland I come from a medical family, and have always appreciated the stressful environment that doctors and nurses work in, especially in this day and age. My upstairs neighbour is training to be an ENT consultant, and judging by the drunken/drug induced ribaldry emanating from his home every other night, I certainly would not wish to be one of his patients. The problem lies with the total acceptance by medical schools of this alcohol culture that has always existed in this particular profession, and can only be getting presently worse. What is acceptable as a student, is not going to change once you are qualified.

D, Epping, Essex Tired, stressed doctors need help to get through their addiction, not recrimination

John, Edinburgh, Scotland As a second year medical student, I would agree that the problem with alcohol very much begins at medical school. Medical student societies seem to exist with the sole purpose of getting their members into a state of oblivion. With this ingrained so firmly into medical students, and with the supposedly ""proud history"" of drunken medics, is it any wonder that there is trouble later on? Yet, I think it important to be sensitive about this. It is all very well for non-doctors to whine incessantly about how easy doctors have it, and how much they get paid. My advice: experience it for yourselves. Tired, stressed doctors need help to get through their addiction, not recrimination. That help should begin at medical school, and extend upwards.

John, Edinburgh, Scotland Apart from the obvious concern regarding the problem of alcohol abuse, the bigger question to be addressed is why the medical profession (doctors in particular) are prone to alcohol dependency. Could it have something to do with stress caused by: the management structure (e.g. no line responsibility for nursing staff, management by administrators not medical professionals) anti-social shift patterns, beligerent patients (e.g. in A&E), stop-go policies (e.g. targets) and more. Did I hear recently that about 2/3rds of junior doctors are leaving for jobs outside medicine - while we recruit from developing countries? This alcohol problem is but just one symptom of a much much larger crisis in medicine.

Jeremy Lumbers, Wimbledon Doctors have feelings and emotions, just like any other person. They take on enormous responsibility and have to cope with horrific cases and feelings of guilt when they (as high achievers throughout childhood), feel they should have been able to do more every time. There are so many people around who have the unspoken feeling of never being quite good enough. Like many other addicts, the socially acceptable bottle provides self medication to try and numb doubt and pain and guilt. Even if they come to acknowledge they have a problem, anyone working in healthcare stands to lose their livelihood with just three words on a sickness certificate - alcohol withdrawal syndrome. My other half has nursed me through tremors, hallucinations, nightmares and deep, deep depression because we both know the consequences of seeking help. I just have to keep things going for another 10 years until my youngest is an adult. If I can keep relapses down to a minimum and keep it as it is now, where I never ever go to work with alcohol in my system, perhaps I can make it. But it's a creeping, progressive disease and it's going to be hard fighting it all alone for another decade. Then one day I will finally be able to say out loud what I know already in my heart - that I am an alcoholic.

Anon, London It is not just Doctors and nurses who drink too much or take drugs, many responsible professional people do it too. The reason this is so controversial is they are directly responsible for people's lives, I think a zero tolerance policy with random testing should be implemented so that medical staff who are over the limit at work are sent home, I work in civil engineering and this applies to us. However this could prove costly, especially when our wards are so short staffed, it will also tie the medical staff up with more and more red tape. This will only work if the cause of the problem is also treated and Medical staff are under a huge amount of pressure due to mismanagement and insufficient funding. Not to mention the emotional stress and trauma of suffering patients, abuse from patients and the constant threat of legal action.

Brian Shoelace, Partick Thistle The vast majority of medics are not affected by these problems

Doctor, Newcastl Where this figure from the BMA has come from I do not know. I know no doctors who are addicted to drink or drugs. I know lots and lots of very hard working doctors who are utterly sick and tired of this media bashing that we get constantly and just want to get on with our jobs. Even if this number was somehow based in fact, the vast majority of medics are not affected by these problems, and continue to try and do their best day in day out, week after week.

Doctor, Newcastle Over twenty years ago I witnessed an organised drinking contest at a famed medical school in London. It went way beyond any other student high jinks I have ever witnessed, and disturbs me to this day. I think the problems are that medics are assumed by all of us and by themselves to be God-like in their power, abilities and responsibilities, when obviously they are not. But medical school breeds in them arrogance, an inability to relate to the real world and a very unhealthy attitude to their own position in it. Solutions? Certainly a rule against drinking 12 hours before going on duty or while on call. More importantly a mission in medical schools to train fully rounded human beings who are skilled in medicine - not 'doctors' for whom human frailties are an embarrassment that they try to deny.

Clare, Oxford I think it is necessary to separate GPs from truly hardworking doctors (at least in Scotland). Although many working people have to work long hours GPs now have an easy 9:00 - 5:00, Monday - Friday job. And they still moan! If they spent more time dealing with patients they wouldn't have the time to get stoned!

Anon, Central Scotland And they have the nerve to tell the rest of the population that they should drink less, smoke less, eat more healthy food, eat less unhealthy food etc. Doctors are the biggest hypocrites in the country.

John, London Hold on a minute! Drink to unwind after the stresses of their days/nights...! I've lived with junior doctors - yes, they do a tremendously difficult job at times but their hours are no longer than the average white collar worker who has other stresses and strains (such as job security) that doctors don't have. Doctors drink heavily because they can get away with it. Also drinking Doctors form the last male bastion (just as boozy lunches used to be the norm amongst stockbrokers in the City of London)

Tim, London D, Dorchester, Dorset has not got a clue in regards to what the doctors have to work through. I would like see D, work an 18 hour day 10 days straight have 1 day off and continue again. The so called limit of hours for a working doctor is ignored by most hospitals in the UK, there is NO support from the medical association, add to that the doctors are still studying for further qualifications, then there is the added stress of the making a mistake which could cost your career, and someone's life. The Doctors in the UK are expected to work with no support, ridiculous hours, and the pay is not as good as most people think.

Darren, London When a patient has an alcohol or drugs problem, they go see their local GP for help. They are provided with support and guidance from someone they trust and all in perfect confidence. Who should a doctor go to when he or she has such a problem? Most likely they know all the doctors they might be referred to - how many of us would feel comfortable talking to a colleague about something so deeply personal and difficult? When a doctor essentially takes on the role of a patient, they should be given as much help and support as they would be expected to give their own patients. The first step is surely to give them somewhere they can go themselves with access to someone they feel comfortable talking to in confidence. They too should have the opportunity to receive as much help and guidance as any other patient would get.

Anon, UK I don't think the general population really understand the constant pressure doctors are under

A, Sheffield, UK I don't think the general population really understand the constant pressure doctors are under. A slight mistake and you'll kill somebody. The only thing that surprises me is that more doctors don't turn to alcohol and drugs. Most people in this country don't know they're born.

A, Sheffield, UK Please. Doctors are people aren't they? Sure enough they should not be drunk when they are treating people but what they do in their own time is entirely up to them. As someone has already said they drink to unwind from a stressful job: being a doctor has to be one of the most stressful jobs - deadlines to keep to, on top of the constant media barrage about hospital waiting times and meeting targets. At the end of the day doctors are just normal people too - it does not mean that they are not allowed to drink but it also does not mean they can flout the rules and jeopardize somebody's life.

Matthew, Norfolk, UK I fully appreciate that doctors and nurses have stressful jobs and quite often work longer hours than the majority of people. That said this is true of a large number of professionals! I can not go out and drink the night before I drive 100 miles to an appointment. Even with a low level of alcohol in my system it is deemed unsafe for me to drive. How on earth can the nurses and doctors who do drink and consume drugs, prior to duty (even 8 hours before) justify their actions, when the very essence of their profession is to preserve life and promote recovery, not put people in grave danger. In my humble opinion, testing for drugs and drink should be introduced, not only to force those with addictions to seek help but to head of the stereotypical behaviour of junior staff who drink heavily and turn up for duty. Finally, after hearing that my local GPs were being paid £1000 per night to be on call as a duty GP often without minor or major incident, in addition of their salary of 100k+, I personally feel their salary alone is recompense for the long, possibly unsociable hours, and sufficiently high to demand high standards of professionalism.

D, Dorchester, Dorset I have run a longitudinal study of doctors over the last 20 years, including questions about their alcohol use. There has been a consistent 5% of them signing up to the top of the alcohol use scale at each 5 year assessment since medical school. As the questionnaires are not anonymous, this is bound to be a large under-estimation. Another 7% sign up to the score below the maximum, which means that at least one in ten know they have a problem with alcohol. In the States this is treated fast and effectively - zero-tolerance but good clinical help on hand - paid for by the doctor - using the AA 12-steps method at its core. Here we ignore it from medical school on. Women medical students are the only group to increase their drinking over their student years and alcohol abuse is a particular problem with women doctors and probably linked to their higher suicide rates as well. British doctors take a laissez-faire attitude to alcohol abuse in their colleagues - partly to do with inherent politeness - and their patients - partly, I suspect, to do with wondering whether they too have a problem and so denying it in both. I was on the Board of Alcoholics Anonymous for some years and many recovering alcoholics on the board talked about going to their GP with ""depression"" and being told to go and have a drink. Perhaps what we are seeing is part of the British love affair with alcohol that infects our young but that is shrugged off as in some way normal. The sooner we work to get over this strange folie a deux the better!

Professor Jenny Firth-Cozens, Kendal, UK Brilliant! Just what the country needs - more fear-mongering about how 'evil' doctors are. Doctors are real people, believe it or not. And as such they have real problems. Perhaps we should be looking at why they have to resort to drink to calm themselves - abuse by ungrateful whining patients who feel the world owes them treatment seconds after they enter the A&E for a bruised knee, drunkards, thugs off the street, druggies and screaming brats. Who can blame the doctors for taking to drink?! I honestly hope this program by the BBC takes some responsibility for a change and looks at why the problem exists.

Bob, Reading, UK A friend of mine was once placed in the residential accommodation for a hospital when he needed somewhere to live. Many of the doctors and nurses that stayed there were in the A&E department of the hospital. They spent much of their spare time getting drunk and taking drugs and I am glad I never had to attend that A&E department. At the time, my friend and I agreed that the doctors and nurses used alcohol and drugs so much because they needed to escape from a very lonely, stressful and depressing job.

Jack, UK I think the employers should shoulder a good proportion of the blame for this problem

Sean Ellis, York It's hardly surprising given the hours that our NHS doctors and nurses are expected to work and the pressures of their jobs. I think the employers should shoulder a good proportion of the blame for this problem, and seek to address it through identification and support of those in need, and also to reduce the conditions that provoke these problems in the first place. It seems that the NHS is not only in denial of the drug and alcohol abuse problems it's staff have, but also of the abuse of the staff by the employers.

Sean Ellis, York, England Surely part of the problem is that young doctors and nurses have to lead extended periods living a student-like lifestyle of long, stressful hours with little opportunity for socialising in less intense ways? Find a way of giving them a more relaxed lifestyle and less of them will end up drinking unhealthily.

Daniel, Cambridge, UK I think this is appalling. Doctors are supposed to be helping patients and setting an example to the people of Britain because they are thought to look after their health because of their profession. In my opinion, the government needs to act fast and as for the doctors, they should face some kind of punishment.

Rizwan Khan, Rochdale England With the NHS in the mess that it is, we should not be surprised that this is happening. Doctors are only people, not superhuman, and seem to be expected by the general public to be able to cope with work and stress loads that most people would find unbearable. So this problem does not lie with the individuals, but the pressures put upon them by public and government expectations.

Medical student, Oxford, Oxfordshire Surely we have to ask why? It's clear that they are working under increasing pressure, and are getting no support. The help they would receive if they were to admit to a drink or drugs problem would be from someone in their own line of work which would be embarrassing and would make them feel at risk of putting their own jobs on the line. Give them a break, literally and let them work more normal hours. Get their management off their back, get the government to support them rather than beat them with a stick to make them work harder.

B, Austria Hold on, what's driving the poor doctor into this state? When you are dealing with hundreds of patients a day, all with different complaints, moaning, screaming and all other things the human race can muster - it's a wonder the medical profession takes to drink. ""Treating illnesses is why we become doctors. Treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable"" - a quote from the TV series House. How right they are.

Horace Ward, Feltham, Middx The onus should be on staff to admit they have a real problem

Devinder Singh, Loughborough I am appalled at this revelation. How can I trust a doctor in future to guide an alcoholic to the path of recovery, when he is in denial about his own problems? I do think NHS should issue guidelines to staff about drinking before duty, but also the onus should be on staff to admit they have a real problem. Only then this problem can be resolved.

Devinder Singh, Loughborough There has been folklore about this problem for decades. I was once told, only half jokingly: ""You're only an alcoholic if you drink more than your doctor.""

Graham, Oxford, UK The problem always has been that the BMA is a trade union looking after its members and not the patients. Until doctors are subject to the same rules as everyone else i.e. governmental control rather than the rules of an old boys club we will always have incompetence in that so-called profession. Drink and drugs are the least of the medical professions' problems, incompetence is rife at every level.

John Sinclair, Dundee, UK Alcohol related disease costs in terms of human suffering and the economy are astronomical and probably exceed those of smoking. So I pose a question. Should alcoholic beverages carry a similar warning to smoking?

Stuart Jones, Aberarth, Wales Why should the tax payer pay for their treatment? Let them be tested by all means but treatment, especially priority treatment, should be the same as that for any other member of the public - wait while suspended or non-contact duties, or go private.

M Durrant, UK What the doctors get up to in their private off duty time is entirely up to them. However while dealing with patients it is essential that the NHS must have a zero alcohol level policy. Especially in the acute intervention areas such as casualty, operating theatres, interventional radiology etc. where a second chance or second opinion may not be available. It is quite cheap to make available breath analysers around acute areas and have either a compulsory or voluntary tests with appropriate policies to support the tests. It should not be made a privacy issue of the NHS staff since there is a public safety issue of possible harm to patients who have already had the misfortune of being ill. The very high pressures of dealing and being responsible for others health, life and death could account for the high prevalence of alcoholism in the medical profession. Existing policies are quite sympathetic and supportive. They should be strengthened by proactive identification and rehabilitation of affected staff who are extremely valuable to the society.

Mr M Hemadri, FRCS Edin, Scunthorpe, UK I'm amazed at some of my colleagues who think it perfectly alright to stay out drinking till dawn and then arrive a few hours later on hospital wards for teaching

Anonymous, Nottinghamshire I'm not at all surprised by this report. I'm a final year medical student at one of Britain's largest medical schools, and in my view one key contributor to this rampant substance abuse problem amongst doctors is the uncontrolled hedonism fostered in on campuses and in medical student bars and clubs up and down the country. I'm no killjoy, but I'm amazed at some of my colleagues who think it perfectly alright to stay out drinking till dawn and then arrive a few hours later on hospital wards for teaching, where they will interact with senior doctors, nurses and patients often obviously hung-over and sometimes incapable. No-one says anything by way of admonishment to them - in fact the ""10 pints, a curry, a fight and then steal a traffic cone"" lifestyle is unconsciously patted on the back by consultants who did it themselves and find ""high jinks"" positively admirable and character building. One can only conclude that this lax attitude (to alcohol in particular), common to all groups of students, spills over into many medical careers, and puts patients at direct risk of harm from doctors more interested in organising their next big night out than on handling the patient in a professional manner. Everyone, particularly hardworking medics deserves some relaxation, but society surely expects doctors and would-be-doctors to behave a little more responsibly than your average lager lout?

Anonymous, Nottinghamshire When doctors have the nerve to preach on the perils of alcohol and drug abuse this news is particularly galling. As for spending more money on helping them get over the problem - no way! They get paid enough already and if they can spend their money on intoxicating themselves, they can pay for their own therapy.

Georgia McDonald, Portsmouth They drink to unwind. They are stressed out due to the extreme pressures of the job, bought on by long hours, victimisation, and bad management. My wife is an ex-nurse. Many of our friends are nurses and on some nights here in Brighton, especially at the weekend, they unwind in the night clubs and let off steam. It is the only way to remain sane. Who can blame them? The more they do the less appreciated they are, especially by middle management in the local hospitals.

Jim Evans, Brighton, UK Alcohol and drug use among the medical profession is a symptom of a bigger problem

Tim Watkins, Cardiff Alcohol and drug use among the medical profession is a symptom of a bigger problem. The profession also has the highest suicide rate of all professions. Part of the problem is the high level of occupational stress, coupled to a macho culture that doesn't acknowledge emotional distress. Part of the problem is typical of all occupations that require individuals to work and take responsibility for their actions individually. The danger is that we will see measures such as random drug testing introduced, without any serious attempts to address the underlying problems.

Tim Watkins, Cardiff, Wales There are many professions out there where any amount of drinking is prohibited prior to going to work (e.g. airline pilots, train drivers). Isn't it about time that surgeons and doctors were asked to do the same thing.

Andy, Brighton, UK At the end of the day these problems exist in all sections of the community and need to be tackled from grassroots level.

Rob Day, Immingham, UK Doctors are like you and me. They all have their issues. They need to admit they have got excesses and get help. They are not super humans and they definitely don't have all the answers. I was once married to a GP and was abused by him but he also has the calm demeanour, that makes people trust him too quickly. His patients think he is the most terrific person they have ever met, but at home he is completely different. I find it hard to trust even my own GP now as I always wonder what he is like really at home with his family. I am not writing off all doctors, but, in my view, most of them have serious problems including this topic that is being discussed.

British psychologist, Rufus May is taking an unusual approach to schizophrenia by encouraging his patients not to battle against their voices - but to embrace them. ""The voice in my head says: 'You have to kill yourself because it's the only way you'll be free,'"" explains a young woman. I have been invited to a meeting of the Hearing Voices Network, a group that encourages people to come together to share their experiences. It is a bit like a meeting of Alcoholic Anonymous: people sit in a circle on plastic chairs; there is tea and biscuits. FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

More from BBC World Service Send us your comments The man chairing the meeting is Rufus May, a psychologist who has dedicated his career to helping people who hear voices. ""Did anyone ever ask you what the voices in your head were actually saying?"" he asks a newcomer. She has just recounted a story familiar to many of those here, of spending years in and out of mental institutions. ""The doctors told the other staff not to pay attention to me when I spoke about the voices; they said it would be playing into my delusions,"" she says. Quirk of nature Traditionally, the psychological community sees voices as a symptom of mental disorders such as schizophrenia or psychosis. Voices are symbolic messages about things that have happened in someone's life

Rufus May But Dr May belongs to a new school of thought that considers hearing voices as a naturally occurring human difference, such as left-handedness or homosexuality - something to be understood, not cured. ""Many people who hear voices never come to the attention of the mental health services,"" he explains. ""But when someone has a traumatic experience, the voices can turn against them, and become frightening."" Even then the voices are still worth listening to, according to Dr May. ""Voices are symbolic messages about things that have happened in someone's life and if we decode them, they are usually trying to tell us about an issue needs to be addressed,"" he says. Dr May has been called a maverick and even labelled ""dangerous"" by the psychiatric community for the methods he uses to treat people who hear voices. He is keen to show me how he works and so I am allowed to sit in on one of his therapy sessions. His patient, Jackie (not her real name) hears two distinct voices, one male and one female. Dr May ignores Jackie sitting opposite him and addresses the voices in her head directly, a little like he is invoking spirits at a seance. ""Is anybody there? Who wants to talk to me today?"" Before long Jackie responds, by repeating exactly what the voice in her head says. ""I hate you! You're always trying to mess things up by telling her she shouldn't kill herself,"" the voice tells him. Not all the talk is aggressive, although it is often surreal. Dr May asks the voices how they enjoyed a recent holiday Jackie took, and while one responds that she quite enjoyed it, the other claims he stayed at home. Jackie seems drained afterwards but she is convinced she benefits from these sessions. ""I used to be afraid to leave the house but in the last few months I've reduced my medication and I feel much better,"" she tells me. Harnessing the voices One of the chairs of the Hearing Voices Network, Pete Bullimore, is testament to how effective these methods can be. I wouldn't want to get rid of my voices now, they're part of me

Pete Bullimore Pete heard his first voice aged seven, after suffering sexual abuse at the hands of a child minder. ""I heard a child's voice telling me to keep going, that everything would be OK. It was reassuring, a bit like an imaginary friend,"" he says. But as the abuse went on the voices increased in number, eventually turning sinister and aggressive. ""They told me to set myself on fire, to slash myself and destroy myself, often 20 or 30 voices all shouting at me at once,"" he says. By his mid-twenties Pete had lost his business, his family, his home, everything. ""The voices just encompassed my life; I curled up in a chair and didn't wash or eat. ""I was locked in a world of voices, paranoia and depression, and it was probably the most frightening time of my life,"" he says. Pete spent more than a decade after that on heavy medication, but the voices never went away. It was only when he came off the medication and met people who share his experience that he was able to stop being so afraid of the voices and actually start listening to them. Life isn't easy. Pete still hears up to 40 voices at a time - it is worse when he is tired or stressed - making it difficult to concentrate and impossible to drive a car. But he has rebuilt his life and has even been hearing a more positive voice recently, which is dictating a children's book to him. He has already written several chapters, and there has been some interest from publishers. ""I wouldn't want to get rid of my voices now, they're part of me,"" he says.

Molly Parkin: Fashioning her own career,"Molly Parkin speaks of her life as a fashion editor, painter, alcoholic and explains how her father's abuse affected her some 70 years later.","['Mario', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Molly Parkin lives in sheltered accommodation in Chelsea but says she prefers it to her 51 previous homes

""It isn't what you've done that you regret, it's what you haven't done,"" says Molly Parkin.

Based on that premise, it must be rather hard for her to have any regrets at all.

Self-proclaimed national treasure, painter, former agony aunt, award-winning fashion editor, theatre performer, erotic author with a dizzying string of former lovers, this 78-year-old has detailed some of her exploits in a memoir, Welcome to Mollywood.

Her own motto for dressing is to rise each morning and ""throw on whatever's nearest, just as long as it clashes"" and it was this life-long extravagant style that led her to catch the eye of the fashion world.

It was searing, that experience of writing about [my abuse], so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote Molly Parkin

In 1964, faced with a lull in her painting career, she was courted by Nova magazine, becoming its fashion editor, before moving on to Harpers and Queen in 1967 and then the Sunday Times in 1969.

Voted fashion editor of the year in 1971, just one of several awards from the fashion world, she quit the industry soon after, turning down many high-profile offers to return elsewhere, leaving it behind forever.

""Fashion was never my world, it's a cruel and superficial world. I never liked it, I wasn't happy in it, although they lauded me with all the distinctions and awards. It wasn't a world I wanted to be in. It was a relief when I left it.""

Such was her unease with the fashion industry that she quit the first two editorial posts without any financial compensation, and worked without a contract at the Sunday Times. Her wayward dealings with money would come back to haunt her.

She was given a chunky, red plastic desk by the Sunday Times when she left, which she still uses now. The adjacent wall is covered with pictures of friends, family and David Beckham in his pants.

Image caption Molly was made fashion editor of the Sunday Times in 1969

Molly is brimming with gripping anecdotes of working with the great and good, but her experiences are underpinned by much darker elements, including her sexual abuse by her father, which she kept a secret until she was in her 60s.

The unflinching detail of her father's behaviour towards her as a child, which she describes in her book, makes for painful and uncomfortable reading, along with the physical beatings he often administered. It's a difficult process for both reader and author.

""It was searing, that experience of writing about it, so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote,"" she says.

""And even that physical exorcism of him was a healing process. The writing of this book has allowed me to come to total compassion and forgiveness for this man.""

She nimbly nips around her cluttered flat, mainly one large room in sheltered accommodation in London's Chelsea, where she has lived since going bankrupt several years ago, the latest of the 52 homes she has lived in as an adult.

The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people Molly Parkin

The place is full of large piles of books, paintings, ornaments, clothes, and all sorts of stuff, with shoes lurking and leaping out to trip any feet navigating the narrow walkways between it all.

She has covered everything in beautiful, if eye-watering, colourful throws, creating richly-explosive mounds all over the small space. It's rather like being inside a melted rainbow.

As she makes a herbal tea in her tiny kitchen, she introduces a large Madonna, two Buddhas and some other religious artefacts, in what she describes as her ""spiritual corner"".

Born in the mining village of Pontycymmer, south Wales, in 1932, she talks of once living in mansions, being showered in gifts by rich lovers, including a vintage Rolls Royce from the year of her birth, bestowed by ""a besotted aristo"".

But all that has now gone, her boutique on the King's Road in Chelsea and her Belgravia restaurant merely distant memories. But at least she managed to conquer the demons of her drinking.

""I used to go to three Alcohol Anonymous meetings a day, just to keep out of the bars,"" she says, now dry for the past 24 years.

She also puts her many fiancees partly down to her alcoholic haze.

""I don't know whatever made people think I'd make good wife material, or that their mothers would like me. They would always invite me over for tea, and then I wouldn't hear from that boy again,"" she chuckles.

Image caption Molly (right) is seen here in her Chelsea art studio in 1961

""I did sit down and started to count the fiancees I'd had. I got to 18 and I thought 'Oh, stop it Moll'.

""You must remember I was a boozer, darling. At the end of the second date - sometimes the first - the person would say 'I'm passionately in love with you Molly, will you marry me?'

""Because I was drunk I'd say: 'That sounds fun.'""

And what of modern fashion? After working with photoshoot budgets that warranted security guards to watch over the precious gems she'd ordered from Bond Street jewellers, what catches her eye now?

""I don't see anything enthralling in the fashion reportage now, not as I did, breaking new ground.

""I like to see fashion seeping all down to youngsters. The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people.""

She also extols the virtues of street markets and buying from charity shops, whose clothes she cuts up to make her own garments, ""because you're helping charities and I like the concept of that.""

She adds: ""I am a humanitarian. Above and beyond even humanitarian, a humanist is what I am.""","['parkin', 'career', 'editor', 'fashioning', 'large', 'fashion', 'times', 'id', 'writing', 'place', 'molly', 'chelsea', 'world']","Image caption Molly Parkin lives in sheltered accommodation in Chelsea but says she prefers it to her 51 previous homes""It isn't what you've done that you regret, it's what you haven't done,"" says Molly Parkin.

You can still join a discussion on the Ouch! Parents' Board

where there are several threads from parents of children with ADHD.

Read more about What Next for Craig?

Read Shelley Jofre's response to your comments

There is absolutely no proven biological cause for ADHD but the use of drugs is based on the misconception that organic causes of the condition can be fixed by the drugs. The frightening truth is that ADHD drugs have harmed and killed many children.

In a similar scandal to the Seroxat issue that was raised by Panorama , The MHRA will not allow data relating to the known risk of suicide for children on the ADHD drug Strattera to be revealed.

I think this is outrageous !

Tom Davies, Berkshire

I was very disappointed that a programme such as panorama could portray a condition in such a biased way, it did nothing but scaremonger. I have a child who has recently been diagnosed with ADHD and aspergers syndrome, my decision to try medication was made based on academic and statistical information as well as opinions from experts and people with personal experience. Unfortunately, some people may not know where to get such information and base their decisions on one sided tripe doled out by people that should know better. When I discussed medication with a child psychiatrist possible side affects were highlighted, as was the fact that it was not a cure. It was also made abundantly clear that medication was only part of treatment as was behaviour management and involvement from services. It was never claimed, at any point, that Ritalin would be a miracle cure. Shame on you BBC.

lynn bellingham, Glasgow Scotland

I was pleased to see the folly of routine drug prescriptions exposed but disappointed not to hear any positive coverage of treatments that really DO work. The Autism Research Institute has been investigating drug-free interventions for years that are healing children across the autistic spectrum every day all over the world. Being drug-free, these interventions receive little or no research funding and are dismissed by the medical profession (who, themselves, are in the pockets of the big pharma companies). I would love to see Panorama cover the scandal of the millions of autistic children who could be recovered if only doctors would listen.

Tim Collins, Stoke, UK

At the time the MTA study was published there were plenty of people pointing out the problems with the study. The main stream psychiatry profession completely ignored them. A lesson from this affair is that the general public, and the media, should be much more sceptical of psychiatric researchers when they discuss ""the latest study.""

Jonathan Leo, USA

Firstly I think Craig needs to be taken of his medication if its not working, he needs to know that his parents are there for him and needs a lot of support and therapy to help him with his ADHD he is crying out for help in the only way he knows how, he has built up a lot of anxiety and anger because he has never had any boundaries.

I have a child that is ADHD and had been on the 36mg concerta until I took her of it as I found she was too much into herself and too quiet, she was of it for 4 months but noticed her concentration was very poor and her homework was impossible for her to complete, both my husband and myself discussed this and thought it better to give a trial run on the new 27mg that had just came out ,six weeks in and she is completing her homework and her schooling has come on her behaviour can be managed. I would love for her to be able to do without medication as I'm not a great lover of medication long term but where would I go and what help would I get for her.

School and parents need to be able to work together using school/home programme and use the classroom assistants for what they are employed for and not for every other job what the school gives them. Children need to be listened to as well and not ignored.

catherine mcardle, belfast

Ill-informed, one sided rubbish. Thousands of published papers over the last 20 years showing clear benefits of methylphenidate and the program chose to talk about one piece of research and speak to a couple of families. Did the same program maker do a piece on MMR?

Anthony Crabb, Dorking, Surrey

I didn't like the tone & implication behind the repeated comment about the number of prescriptions being written by GPs for Ritalin and other drugs. I am a GP, I do prescribe Ritalin but only on the advice of a child psychiatrist or paediatrician after they have carried out their assessments. The implication of the presenter was that GPs are haphazardly prescribing these drugs when there isn't necessarily evidence to support them ie. yet more GP bashing by the media that we are not doing our job properly & just clearing our consulting rooms by prescribing expensive, possibly ineffective & harmful drugs. These is not my experience at all amongst the hardworking, dedicated GP community that I know. In my experience ADHD is often about parenting issues, in my area there are no parenting courses currently available, there are few options for managing these often very challenging youngsters. It is frustrating & as GPs we try our best to support these families. Please stop running us down all the time.

Rachel Firth, Amersham, Bucks

My eldest son was diagnosed with ADHD from the age of 7 and was prescribed Ritalin. I felt the programme was very negative in relation to medication. My son has found that using Ritalin has helped him learn in the mainstream education system and achieve academic results. He has also grown into a well balanced young person with very good communication and social skills. He is 18 now and in his first year at Southampton University. He continues to take Concerta because he feels it benefits him whilst studying.

The Panorama programme did mention, but did not put much emphasis on Craig's early attachment difficulties within his family which possibly may be the main underlying cause of his oppositional and anti social behaviours. Attachment difficulties and other trauma's a child experiences often can present behaviours similar to ADHD. In these circumstances a better initial assessment with details of family history may shed light on negative behaviours that can better be addressed within a therapeutic environment.

Ms Chamberlain, Brighton

I was very disappointed with the show. My son has adhd and asd and he has been on medication since he was six and it has been a great help as he has just sat his 11 plus and with out the medication there would of been no way he could of done that. Their hasn't been any problem with his height as one of the doctors said in the show. My daughter of six also has adhd and is not on medication yet but when it comes to her taking it there wont be a problem as it has worked for my son. It would of been nice to see someone that is on medication and doing ok as you gave was the bad things about taking the medication, what about the children who do take it and are happy and doing well at school. I hope the programme has put any parents of putting their child on medication.

lynn, gillingham kent

A very good programme with many similarities to my own son and the problems he has dealt with in his life coping with ADHD or not!!. School would not allow him to attend if he did not take his Ritalin and I now know that Ritalin was a waste of time. He is now 23 unemployed, depressed and dependant on cannabis, his excuse being that cannabis keeps him level. We have been to the GP who referred him to a psychiatrist who would not help him until he has come off the cannabis. I am frightened for his future as he is a lonely young man who doesn't know where his life is going or what the future holds. The only friends he has are other users of cannabis and drugs. Where is the help out there when they reach adulthood?????? He was discharged at 16 as he didn't come under children's services anymore.

These people who blame bad parents can look at our family and see that his older brother is courting, purchasing his own home, is a warehouse manager and 24 years old. I empathise with all parents of children with ADHD and truly believe it is a problem that is not being dealt with as the Dr said if it was cancer it gets dealt with by the NHS, why not ADHD???? it is still an illness is it not??????

Anyway thank you for giving me the change to vent some of my frustrations even though I know you are unable to help.

A very frustrated and weary mother.

PS Has there been any studies done in the correlation between cannabis/illegal drug use and ADHD sufferers???

Mrs Rice, Brighouse. UK

Why can't we just call this condition what it is - naughtiness. Did you not notice the similarity in that both children featured lost their fathers influence early in their development? By 14 it is very late to start dealing with unacceptable behaviour which has not been corrected earlier, but as the programme showed, these kids need help (including an understanding of boundaries and consequences of bad behaviour), NOT drugs.

John Howell, Swansea UK

How much research has been done on what happens to ADHD people in adulthood, much is said about children, but life is tough for partners who are with sufferers of this condition, perhaps a programme on adults would be beneficial to a lot of people

Barbara Padley, Market Harborough, England

Shocked and very disturbed at the programme as no reporting on those who may have experienced a positive slant on the use of the medication was provided. I really hope there is a positive side as I am now in confusion and totally scared by what your reporting disclosed. A balanced view was not presented which may create alarmist reactions. Our eight year old has been on the said medication since March this year - the difference in her attention at school, her interactions and general behaviour is dramatic. Before starting the tablets she said 'oh, I hope this works Mummy'. So now takes it gladly as she really understands and appreciates the difference it has made to the quality of her life. I can say without doubt that it has improved things immensely, and made a huge difference also to our lives and her ability to actually learn, make friends and enjoy school.

We are now left in a dilemma - are we now causing her major problems in the future? Was it wrong for her consultant t to prescribe them? Why were no British consultants interviewed? Was this drug introduced solely on the research undertaken in the USA? I thought we had British Standards and testing? I feel the one sided reporting of this programme may have caused untold damage to those parents who actually found the use of this medication made everyone's life better. We obviously now have to review and see the doctor ASAP - as I imagine many others in our position will now be doing.

Thank you for not only making us have to go back to square one, but also having to live with the knowledge that we may have caused untold damage to our precious child!

ruth gould, Liverpool UK

My son was diagnosed at 5 and is now 13. He is on concerta, was on Ritalin, I know he would struggle without the tablets, relationships would be extremely difficult, and he would find it impossible to remain in mainstream school. He is doing really well, loves school and has relatively good self-esteem and confidence. However life is always a roller coaster with him, and needs constant work and dedication. It is extremely difficult to remain calm, but remaining calm, and a hug and kiss morning and night ensure no matter what he is loved, and we try to work together, and not against each other. I am a single parent, and I don't always do things right, but it is important to help and support and constantly, gently remind him to stop and think about things, and praise him and enjoy it when he is settled. I cant imagine what his life would be like, without his medication.

Sonya Slaine, cookstown

What a shocking indictment of the British NHS. I have an ADHD child and drug only treatment has never been recommended by any doctor I have consulted or literature I have read in 17 years. ¿Drugs only' are just not effective, drugs help a child control their behaviour so that the Behavioural Management Techniques can be learnt, not magically make the child well behaved.

What the programme has showed is that the NHS and many doctors are woefully ignorant of the condition, as are the majority of teachers in the British education system. The only people who suffer are the children and parents with little or no support, compare this to the amount of support provided by the US medical and education establishments, where ADHD is much more understood.

Sue Laverick, Spain

Whilst clinical psychologists are very useful in the diagnosis and management of ADHD as well as other difficulties they can not prescribe medications. People need to be aware that there are many inaccuracies in the comments made about this programme, adding to the confusion and poor advice

N, London

A very informative programme, sat crying for the family, hoping that my child does not go down that track. My son was on Ritalin for about 5 years, is now on atomoxetine(strattera). We now when he has not taken medication, he is more difficult with his behaviour, run riot around the house and generally disrupts everything. He attends a special school and they are very supportive. His specialist is very good so cannot fault her, but he has recently been diagnosed with epilepsy, could this be a lasting result of taking Ritalin or a condition that was miss diagnosed earlier on . Hope that other people leave comments on conditions their child have developed after coming off Ritalin.

allison bird, wolverhampton, england

My son has recently been diagnosed with ADHD and ASD and I agree with Panorama that giving them drugs is a waste of time they need support and educating on how to deal with the problem, and as parents how to learn to diffuse a child before it escalates. I have been asked on numerous occasions to put my son on Ritalin (he's6) and I have flatly refused, I will never go down this route.

Karen Bassett, Birmingham

Medication is only one part of the help that should be offered to children like Craig. Counselling, therapies such as speech therapy, anger management etc AND, above all else, support for the parents all play a major part in providing a cohesive package of support.

My son has ADHD/Aspergers and is doing reasonably well due to a combination of the above.

Frustratingly, I had to learn about the condition myself and use that as leverage to obtain the necessary help (and to tailor my parenting approach to help him). Children like Craig have been let down by a system which DOES NOT make such a tailored package of support available. This failure is much more responsible for letting these children down - it is a very simplistic and ignorant approach to simply blame the medication.

Graham Ferguson, East Lothian

It is important to point out that Ritalin (Methyl-phenihydrate) is NOT a trycilic/SSRI type medication and is NOT addictive at regular dosage levels.

Children can easily stop taking Ritalin without the scary withdrawal symptoms mentioned by the well-meaning Euphoria.

My son does not take Ritalin at weekends or during school holidays as it is not needed. He suffer NO ill-effects.

Graham Ferguson, East Lothian

I congratulate the Panorama Team on this programme. I have an adopted four year old child with disorganised attachment disorder which only came to light a year after he was placed with us.

These children appear to have almost the same problems, disruptive, can be very hyper aroused, aggressive, poor concentration skills and unpredictable behaviour. We have just requested a day report book from school because in our own case it is crucial what maybe happening at school or via versa has a direct correlation as to how the day will unfold. Often children maybe being misdiagnosed with ADHD at present rather than an attachment issue when in fact it maybe due to a change in their family and home situation which may not have been taken into consideration. I would have liked to know about what work they do on the summer camp of Professor Pelham as it would certainly help us!

Katherine Bowen, Tenby

I was extremely shocked that such a supposedly factual program could broadcast such a sensitive and real condition to lots of families in such a biased, basic, and unfactual way. Ritalin and similar medications are not prescribed by GPs but by Clinical psychologists after months, and sometimes years of assessment and intervention. Drugs have never been sold as a cure or a solution, but as something to use in conjunction to other therapies. ADHD is a chemical imbalance in the brain, drugs help the chemical imbalance, when the subject is then focused it is only at that point that behavioural strategies can be truly taught and absorbed.

All you have done is fuelled the already raging fire about the 'realness' of ADHD - ADHD is real - there are families out there suffering, and drug intervention has saved many of these. I hope any pray that you have not scared off a load of vulnerable, (and in need of real help and advice), parents who will now fail to give their children the essential help they need. I just thank my lucky stars that I am one of the parents who has invested years and money to truly understand ADHD, Medication and other therapies and see your program for what it is - negative media hype - ignoring the bigger picture to boost ratings.

Hazel, South London

I watched last night's Panorama with interest. I work within a Child Development Centre and we have a high proportion of children who are diagnosed with ADHD. Whilst medication has its place in the treatment of this syndrome, so also has professional behavioural management support and psychological treatment. Craig was clearly crying out for professional psychological assessment and support but we simply do not have sufficient psychologists/psychiatrists to support all these children. I do not feel this aspect of ADHD treatment was put across during the programme, simply medication and drugs. Both have their place in management of this syndrome.

Pippa Russell, Shoreham by Sea, West Sussex

This recent programme really got to me as a mother of a son who is nine with adhd. I totally agree that medication is only the start of helping children cope with adhd and there is not enough behaviour therapy to help them deal with there adhd ,the meds only control there hyperactivity how they learn and process there behaviour is totally different to how others do ,to me the psychologist, docs etc have always looked at adhd as a behaviour problem that the parents should deal with. If all adhd children were given behaviour therapy from when they were first started displaying symptoms it would make it a hell of a lot easier for the child to cope with adhd .

mrs hopper, south shields uk

I noted on the programme that Craig was drinking Coca Cola and that diet which is crucial in cases like this was not mentioned on the programme. Coca Cola is a chemical drink and if he has a leaky gut those chemicals will go straight to his brain. A combination of a diet with the advice of a biomedical clinician together with therapy would help Craig more than anything else.

Eugenie C Smith (Mrs), Essex, United Kingdom

I was really interested to see the one activity Craig taking part in on the your Panorama programme on ADHD was fishing. I head up a national charity 'Get Hooked on Fishing' where we deliver training programmes for young people using fishing as the focus of our activities. We have a lot of anecdotal evidence of youngsters who can't be still for 5 minutes spending hours on a bankside fishing suggesting that it is an excellent engagement tool for youngsters with ADHD. We have started to log the evidence more formally and are working in partnership with a social research company - Substance Coop to provide the evaluation we need to prove its impact.

Anne Moyle, Northumberland, England

I am yet again feeling in despair by media pouring scorn on this terrible disability. Where do we as a family go now. Thank god we chose to view your programme before letting our 11 yr old watch. It is no wonder children are being driven to suicide with a society that keeps discrediting their affliction. The frustration I feel as a parent is nothing to what a person with ADHD feels. I felt you needed to back up this programme with anything else we need to do to help our kids get the help and understanding they need. My son is a star, he attends an amazing state school on Derbyshire, I am very proud of him. I want society to understand also.

Clare Vickers, Ripley Derby

This was an interesting programme, I am currently studying Childhood Studies and my personal subject interest is ADHD and the cause and effect of Ritalin. I found the evidence regarding the ongoing use of Ritalin interesting and I have to say hardly surprising. A family member has been diagnosed with ADHD and has never had Ritalin due to the fact that he was diagnosed at the age of 16 and therefore to old to receive medication. The tactics our family have used to control his outbursts of anger are to remain calm and let him believe he has control. In the main this has worked and he has significantly calmed since we have used these tactics and ensure we listen to how he is feeling and read his moods. This report was good although biased to the young girl who seemed to control her own life and when she came off the medication. Well done to her. But what I would like to know is how is Panorama going to help Craig and his family after this report and what will you do to help Craig gain control of his life again? Good Luck to Craig and his family. A sympathetic viewer.

Emily Pugh, Glosssop, England

I found this programme really disappointing. I think it was far too one-sided, mostly focusing on the negative aspects of Ritalin/Concerta. I think it was just scare-mongering and not helpful at all. The only thing i found of use was hearing that NICE are working on guidelines for the management of ADHD. I am a parent of a 9 year old with ADHD (and also Autism)and Concerta has meant that he can focus at school and actually learn. Surely this will benefit him in the long run? Without Concerta he cannot sit still or focus long enough to learn ANYTHING at school and he is a highly intelligent child. ADHD causes the child to be impulsive, posing a risk of danger to themselves and others. Concerta helps to control this impulsiveness. Overall, i think this programme was a complete waste of time. It was all based on the ""research"" of ONE American Doctor, with whom i would love to challenge to ""cure"" my son without the need for medication.

helen coates, welwyn garden city, herts

my son got diagnosed 2yrs ago, and on medication, i find it has improved him and is a lot better at school, yes i didn't want him to take the med but if it weren't for the med he wouldn't be in his school today and wouldn't get the support he needs, I do feel that the tablets are effective for him and as for a.d.h.d not being real i suffered for years, without help, and people saying that i was naughty, or my parents were not a good role model. I think parents could do with a lot more help to understand and have a lot more support for the child and the family as a unit, as the other children suffer as well

nicola, swansea

""What children need is our understanding. What they don't need is to be drugged."" So a child with Meningitis needs understanding not drugs, then? Many medical conditions must be treated by drugs if there is to be any hope of success. That includes medical conditions of the brain.

Andrew Shore, Salisbury, Wiltshire

I am 33. I suffer from ADDHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Aspergers Syndrome. I have never had any medication for any of my disabilities. The only thing I have done every day since I was 22 is Tai Chi. I am now a Chartered Accountant. There is definitely a link between Tai Chi and the various difficulties I have. Medication is not the best course of action.

Ben Lee, Birmingham. west Midlands

A very good programme about Craig with adhd . is was well researched by the programme makers i have got a son who has adhd and that is exactly how my son behaves

suzanne osborne, swansea

ADHD makes people ""zombified"" eh? ADHD makes people not themselves? I was diagnosed age 6 and I've been waiting YEARS for somebody to say something like that on national TV. Well done, Yaz, very well done indeed.

Ian Hare, Wilmslow, UK

While watching a programme that brings ADHD to the attention of the general public I do have a problem with watching the children drinking full sugar drinks straight from the litre coca cola bottle! I was a problem child yet have a child who is well behaved, nice, polite, above average at school and well adjusted child you could meet, and all this from a single parent, myself. I was a problem child due to rubbish that I was allowed to eat and drink, our bodies are not designed to process the sugars and fats that today's children enjoy. They do not need them, they causes false highs and lows. Why are these issues not addressed? I have raised my son on a diet filled with healthy eating, with some sugar and the occasional fizzy drink, he doesn't know any different.. he certainly does not feel left out and prefers water to pop, multi grain bread to white and swears by asparagus and artichokes. I would love to see a programme that takes children with ADHD and provides a better diet just to see if it works¿. Even for one of them. Thank you for reading, Rachel

Rachel Graham, Nottingham UK

I sympathise with the parents i have 2 children with ADHD 1 is 24 and the other is 13 and it is very hard to get any help from anywhere because they state ""It's a mental health issue"" and that medication is the best form of treatment.

Ms Susan Round, Welling Kent

I had been taking Ritalin (concerta and equsim) and it has turned my life around, i sometimes feel that people get away with stuff because of Adhd when you just need to be treated like everyone else

Adam , Surrey

These were not run of the mill ADHD cases, surely? And what was Craig doing drinking Coca Cola??? That is a definite NO!!!!

russ hurley, hereford

Shockingly lazy journalism. The evidence we were given was from one study and the case histories of two young people for whom (it seemed to me) ADHD was the least of their problems. Both had family/emotional difficulties when they were at a very vulnerable age and there was little said about the schools the older girl had gone to. My son has ADHD and is on Ritalin but this has never been sold to me as a miracle cure. I have always been to that is one of many strategies that should be used to help my son. Yet again Panorama has sensationalised and simplified a very complex issue.

CAROLE ASHWORTH, Glasgow

You misrepresented the truth by stating that thousands of medications for ADHD are prescribed by GPs. They are not. They are prescribed by Child Psychiatrists and ISSUED thereafter by GPs. There is a big difference between these statements as according to your version, it is GP's responsibility that ADHD is overpresribed and even over diagnosed. You see, many times I have told families that their child has not ADHD and I offered them a referral to parenting skill courses but when they are eventually seen by a psychiatrist, they get labelled as ADHD and given methylphenidate. It is a pity that you only focused on the drugs used and nil else such as the diagnosis itself, what would take to change the present system etc. I can guess that you will get a large amount of nasty messages from angry parents. You must admit that thirty minutes is nothing to tackle this subject. Good luck

GP, Dr Herrero, doncaster, uk

This programme is a true reflection of how life is for ADHD kids, their families and teachers in the UK. There is no support from the NHS in the form of any type of therapy or advice. I had to seek advice from a charitable organisation, even the local education authority recommended this organisation!

The local authority also informed one of his teachers that 'as soon as they start taking the tablets it will all go away' when he sought advice. Its a shambles - i teach in a school for 14 -16 yr old who are classed as having emotional and behavioural difficulties and guess that the majority of them would be classed as having ADHD and receive no help or advice. You might want to ask the teacher training agency how much time is spent in teacher training on managing behaviour.

Susan Halton, Westhoughton, UK

Thank you very much for covering this subject matter. My sister who lives in Canada has a 10 year old son who has been diagnosed with ADHD. The doctors want to prescribe drugs but my sister is adamant against it. Because she is of the opinion that drugs must only be the absolute last resort. I have sent her the link to this programme and hope it helps her get an understanding of what other countries are doing about their hyperactive children. Additionally I am approaching 50 and had always said I would change my career to something more altruistic. After watching this programme I am considering becoming a psychologist that specialises in working with children.

So keep up the good work:-)

Sincerely, Kimikawa

Kimikawa De Castro, London

It seems to me that all people with mental illness of any kind ADHD or Depression, to name a few are just given Drugs as a kind of so called fix. when nearly everyone needs proper emotional and behaviour therapy and help but there are not enough people willing to help and we can't find the money to fund this kind of help. so people get palmed of with drugs and left to it. lots of people then spend there entire lives as kind of emotionless numb drugged zombies. it's a great shame it's happening to people at younger ages like poor Craig. The whole system needs rethinking, Britain is a very depressed country thousands here suffering and the figures are rising. I don't think that any government or medical body will address this or even attempt to do anything about it. The lucky few will get the help they need.

Jessica Mackie, Corsham England

Tonight's programme (12/11/07) really enforced the view that myself and my Husband already had with regards to my Stepson being prescribed medication for his behaviour. We are already of the opinion that despite his Mother bleating to the Doctor that she can't control my Stepsons behaviour, the main concern is really about how he's parented. Her parenting skills are (for want of better words) non existent. In our home my Stepson is a fantastic, caring, polite and well behaved little boy, yet whilst in his Mothers care he's like a totally different child who swears, has outbursts of emotional and physical anger and he physically pushes his Mother about.

We have always given clear boundaries and guidelines as to what behaviour is acceptable and what behaviour is not and we strongly believe that those boundaries and guidelines are respected hugely by my Stepson in our home. We're not perfect parents but we do know that all children need to have consistency, boundaries/guidelines and some firmness in their lives to help keep them on the straight and narrow and they need to made aware that there will always be consequences in life for bad behaviour. My Stepson has actually called me a 'cool step mum' because I tell him off when it's needed and when asked how he worked that out his reply was "" I know you tell me off because you care about me and you want me to learn right from wrong"". Those words from the mouth of a 10 year old little boy whose Mother and Doctor deem that the most appropriate way of `controlling` him is to give medication instead of correct advice and parenting skills. No wonder the Health Care system never seems to have enough money when so much is being wasted on drugging kids with no real need for it.

Lisa, Dorset , England

What a brilliant programme it confirmed everything we had thought about the medication and related well to our family life. We will now be taking steps to fight to get our son the behaviour / anger management he needs to live an independent and happy adult life.

Georgina Deviell, Sittingbourne Kent

I have a son with ADHD for whom I have sought medical and psychiatric support. The combination I fought to receive has greatly benefited my son, our family and his school environment. I feel this help should be offered to all families, not only those who can forcefully articulate their needs.

Alison Scott, Lancaster UK

I am 40 years old one of the first diagnosed cases of ADHD in the UK at the age of 8 i saw specialist after doctor at GOSH and was in the lancet more times then i had hot dinner

I had no medication EVER also i was NOT naughty or disruptive or prone to temper tantrums

My cerebral fluid ran 6x faster through my spine then that of an ordinary child I was measured poked tested

I feel ADHD is to freely diagnosed now parents lose control the child knows by having a tantrum he gets his own way so the circle builds until the child has no boundaries I still have ADHD i cope i would not have drugs my 3 sons have ADHD they are bright alert kids very clever and i know how to channel there extra energy

Parents need to take a look at their skills before filling kids with mind altering medication

Andrea Abbott, Braintree

I spent the evening watching the Panorama programme on ADHD and it was one of the most infuriating 30 minutes I have spent in a long time. The programme concentrated too much on the oppositional behaviour of one child and did not give a broad understanding of the condition, the associated disorders and the accepted range of procedures available to assist parents and the children. It added no educational benefit and only served to reinforce prejudices that already exist both nationally and internationally.

Apart from a brief viewing of the US management school there was no detailed explanation of the support available or the management practices that can assist with an ADHD child; practises such as diet management or provision of good and regular structure.

As a parent of an ADHD son, who can be a challenge and an immense pleasure, I feel that your programme was ill judged and an uneducated and misdirected report.

Pip Tonkins, Camberley, Surrey

OK, you have done it again....our 16 year old ADHD son is absolutely furious with your programme. He was diagnosed when he was 6 years old. He has been the route of controlled medication and still takes Strattera the last one available to him (not a controlled substance). He is well adjusted, extremely intelligent and just like other teenagers, sometimes a lot easier. The child Craig on the programme needs to have his diet sorted, the first thing our son said when he was watching was ""he's drinking coke, what do they expect!!"". We discovered the hard way that all additives and colours need to be excluded from the diet - it doesn't cure but it sure helps with the behaviour. As does a support network from the local child and adolescent Psy clinic. They too have been absolutely brilliant. When will you guys get it right and look at the children as a whole and not just the mouthy, obnoxious out of control ones - Channel 4 did this years ago with Kid in the Corner. They got 4 A4 pages off me for that one! Try looking at a broader spectrum of ADHD kids and then report on that, probably not as sensational but it will be more factual!

Angry mum of ADHD teenager, Oxford, Oxon

I thought that the programme was good because it raised awareness to an important issue. The only criticism I have is that, at the end, Jeremy said ""A.D.H.D. child"". This is insulting, I believe, to people who have A.D.H.D. I feel that he should have said ""a child with A.D.H.D."" or ""a child who suffers from A.D.H.D."", as this implies that A.D.H.D is not the main feature of the person. They are children who have a condition, not conditions which have a personality. I am fortunate enough to not suffer from A.D.H.D., but I felt strongly about making this point: a condition doesn't define a person.

sarah Naismith, Glasgow, Scotland

To be fair medication works for sum people and not for others fort it was a bit against medication but for sum people medication mite be the only avenue as for it not working it works for me how ever I also believe that medication is the only ANSER COS ITS NOT

Gary sendall, wirral merseyside

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on tonight's programme. I feel compelled to state the obvious and the obvious is there is no such thing as a chemical solution (Ritalin) to a spiritual problem. Quite simply these children present themselves with emotional difficulties and the so called misinformed professionals have made a generation of addicts. I am convinced that a simple 12 step programme as practised in Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous which is spiritual by nature offers a real solution to anybody who wants to get better from a grave emotional behaviour and/or mental disorder. I have the disease of addiction and I recognise the symptoms in each and every one of the children featured tonight. I have recovered from ADHD through the working and practising of the 12 steps in my life and so have many 1000's of my friends. I am available to offer direction should this be required.

david leven, Stanmore, Middlesex

It comes as no surprise that long term use of any drug didn't solve the problem that it was originally prescribed for. It was also no surprise that the girl featured in this evening's programme actually faired better without the medication.

Drugs have their uses but here was another example of how useless and often how harmful they actually are in the treatment of chronic conditions.

It may interest the makers of this programme to know that I have a young colleague (early 20's) who is taking around 25 pills a day to manage a condition called Lupus. Needless to say some of these pills are prescribed not for the condition itself but to counteract the side affects of some of the original medications. I also have a friend of 24 years who has been prescribed statins purely as a preventative measure because her father died in his 40's from a heart attack.

A nurse friend of mine's describes GPs as licensed drug pushers and my worry is that she maybe has something there.

Kairin van Sweeden, Tayport, Fife. UK

Whilst I agree that medication doesn't work for some children, and shouldn't be used without other supportive therapy, I have to disagree with most of the Panorama programme. The 16 year old who stopped taking Ritalin and felt better for it was not an unusual case, this is about the age where these drugs should be reviewed and in a lot of cases stopped anyway. As for Craig, the film quite clearly showed him drinking coke and eating chocolate. I know from bitter experience with my own ADHD 11 year old that no matter how well the medication helps her, it can all be undone by eating the wrong foods. She watched the programme with me and was very upset, she is on Concerta and is doing fantastically and has been for four years. She asked me why you didn't show anyone who is doing well on the medication. Its a shame when an 11 year old can clearly see biased reporting.

Saira, Maidstone Kent

Unfortunately, no mention of the children for whom medication has been a lifeline. My son was also on Ritalin for a while, it helped in that it calmed him and enabled him to focus at school. However, he still had outbursts resulting in 40 days exclusion in one school year. He recently started Strattera and is completely different and so far this school year not a single problem, he comes home from school happy now and not frustrated, he is enjoying his education, and we are enjoying him now !!

ADHD Parent, Accrington

I watched your program with great interest. I have two children aged 10 and 8 who have ADAS/ADHS, not quite so problematic as Craig, however they share the same symptoms. They are both prescribed Medicenet retard, 30mg and 20mg, which helps them both considerably, and both children are much better at school. I have found that what they eat and drink reduces the symptoms and helps them to concentrate better. We give them no milk products, a good substitute is soya. I also watched with horror as Craig was drinking coca cola. Sugar based products are not very helpful for children who suffer with ADHS. We try to give our kids fresh food when possible , no dairy or wheat products and only sweet things with cane sugar. They drink plenty of water. To end I would say that it is a perhaps more expensive to feed your children with bio products, however the peace of mind outweighs the financial burden

Stephen Read, Hannover, Germany

I found this programme to be unfair to the true realities of adhd. The boy in the programme was an absolute extreme adhd sufferer and did not portray many of the children suffering from adhd today. Only the extreme was looked at and no other. Also to suggest that no recorded evidence that Ritalin helps is absolute rubbish! My child suffers from adhd and if it had not been for Ritalin he would not be where he is today, from a very naughty unliked child to one who is very well liked by friends, polite, excellent at school and most of all happy for not being in trouble all the time. I feel the show was a scare tactic and should have been investigated further from both sides.

Gemma Merritt, Ilfracombe, Devon England

I am a mother of a 9 year old girl who has adhd, and has been on medication for 3 years. She is doing well at school on her medication and is mostly why i decided to medicate. This programme has worried me a lot.

elaine whitehead, selkirk

Watched the programme with great interest as my 13 year old has been on various forms of Ritalin for 6 years. Can I just say we can definitely see a difference if he missed his meds or is late with it and although he has always had a poor appetite he is currently growing well.

Lorraine, Stroud Glos

Interesting insight into the world of adhd. My 11yr old has this condition and was fascinated about how severe it can be for the child my son has a mild case but has drugs to help him he is doing ok and we are managing his condition

donna, stevenage uk

I have two children with ADHD and ADD I have ADD myself. Both of my children aged 21 and 24 have achieved getting outstanding jobs and both have mortgages on their own we have had our highs and very bad low's. My son started taking Ritalin at 11 and stopped at 16 and started again at 23 and my daughter started taking it at 15 and is still on it. I only need to take Ritalin when things are really bad. Your programme showed negativity about Ritalin it saved our family and for us it was a miracle drug and still is. Education on this problem is well overdue in schools and GP surgeries I managed on my own with my children's problems because of the lack of help. I feel we have gained in life through having this problem and would not want to change the past. My family is a close unit and we have a strong bond.

Kim Smee, Gravesend Kent

I thought the programme was very much the way ADHD really is. My son is 15 and was at a special school which was brilliant for him, but earlier this year he was expelled, because of a sexual incident with another boy, he doesn't understand about his sexuality at all and thinks sex is just something people do and has nothing to do with emotions. Emotions are something that he does not comprehend. The education dept here are useless and have now put him in a school that only provides half a days schooling a day, for kids that basically have nowhere else to go. All the good work that was done at the school with him is now undone and he is like a loose cannon, heading for a life of crime. Where is the help. Virginia Eden

Virginia Eden, Bury St Edmunds, England

I feel for Craig's mum, I have two boys who were diagnosed with ADHD at 5 & 11 (now 20 & 24)you get no support both my boys have criminal records now as no one was willing to help me. so if you manage to get help & support you are very lucky.

Mrs Theresa Wood, Feltham, Middlesex

AT LAST! I've been saying this for years!

Thank you Panorama for making an effort to save these children.

All that needs to be done now is to prove that ADHD doesn't exist. There are a variety of reasons for children's 'bad behaviour'.

Anonymous,

I am outraged that the programme on ADHD made it seem as if Doctors are shoving it down peoples' throats - You have to fight to get Ritalin in this country, and it gets harder as you get older. There are only two specialists for adult ADHD in this country that can keep Ritalin prescribed for adults (ADHD is genetic, you do not ""grow out of it""), one in Cambridge, and one in London. If even those 55,000 children mentioned maintained their Ritalin into adulthood, each of those specialists would have to treat 22,500 patients a year. Britain is most certainly failing its ADHD citizens, but not at all in the way that was made out.

My son has been on different medication for ADHD and has tried many behavioural techniques. Alongside each other my son no longer gets frustrated at himself but can focus more clearly and I no longer find him crying in his room saying he's just a stupid boy!!! I do feel however there is a serious lack of support and knowledge surrounding this area from the NHS and within schools, perhaps if this was improved there would be less reliance on medicating .

Leeann Dunn, Scotland

All this has shown was where meds have not worked. How about showing to a point of where meds have worked, as it has worked very well for my son, only for his schooling. At home my son is not on meds, as i make time to have one to one with my son at home. It was very misleading to the point on tonight show.

Mr D Farrington, banstead

we have just been watching the panorama report on A.D.H.D. our son Adam is 14 and is also A.D.H.D. and takes medication for this condition and we feel that your report only gives one side of using medication for this condition if you come and ask Adam if the medication has helped him you would get a totally different answer to the question than you portrayed in the programme and we feel the program is very one sided and not all A.D.H.D. children are monster who have a devastating effect on family life.

I enjoyed watching this programme. As a pharmacist dealing with these medicines on a daily basis, I believe that the comments made were not entirely accurate. Ritalin and other medicines licensed for the treatment of ADHD are suppose to be used with cognitive behavioural therapies and counselling. There have been numerous studies showing that the use of psychological and pharmaceutical support is far superior to any treatment on its own. I do not recall this being mentioned in the programme. The national institute for clinical excellence has issued guidelines on this- this was not mentioned. I believe that the programme was a little biased.

sharon hughes, amlwch anglesey

I have a 14 year old son who was correctly diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and is now taking Concerta XL. Having lived with this for 14 years I had by default implemented any behavioural strategies suggested. The medication has made a massive improvement to his life. Unfortunately I felt the Panorama programme showed two real extremes of the illness and completely ignored where the majority of sufferers fall. Clearly this makes better viewing but is not helpful for peoples' perception of the illness. I would not change my son's medication for anything, he is now achieving at school and in his own words ""my head feels more still"" As the programme touched on, untreated children often go on as adolescents to be in trouble with the police, take drugs, have alcohol problems and as they are thrill seekers many are killed in teenage car crashes. Not for my son thanks.

As a parent of a child with ADHD I was very disappointed by the Panorama Programme What Next For Craig? Ritalin has been marvellous for my son and has transformed his performance at school. Why were none of the hundreds of psychiatrists successfully prescribing Ritalin interviewed? Up and down the country nervous parents will be wondering whether they should ignore their professional medical advice. This is a desperately serious matter for people like me, but you dealt with it in a biased and sensationalist way.

Tony Warren, England

Whilst watching last night's Panorama, what made me feel very sad is the fact that nothing else was offered to Craig other than Ritalin, from a very early age. Craig came across as a very lost and sad teenager, with little or very low self esteem who was constantly crying out for help, no much difference to when he was 6 years. If intervention had been consistent, instead of moving him from a school he was doing well in, then he may have been off Ritalin by now, hence not lashing out at his teachers, resulting in a court appearance.

Craig is now only getting the help he has been crying out for all these years because he broke the law. That is fundamentally WRONG.

Instead of 'labelling' children with ADHD as 'naughty' and 'bad', we should begin to see them for what they really are; 'Children who are often very intelligent but have difficulty expressing their thoughts clearly in any given social situation. That, to my mind is a disability just like any other, which can only be re-directed through therapeutic intervention and not medication.

Eleanor Jane Roberts, London

I have to say that i am very disappointed with this programme. You have done nothing but promote negative awareness of this condition, and have made it worse for the children and adults who continue to suffer peoples ignorance to this condition. Are you aware that doctors, lawyers, teachers, politicians, social workers have children with adhd who take medication. Why did you focus on the fact that the two children that you featured came from broken homes, ADHD is not down to poverty or broken homes.

I was looking forward to seeing this programme because i had hoped that panorama being the quality programme that i thought it was, would give a balanced view, but you haven't, you have just continued to fuel the fire of ignorance that surrounds this condition.

Michelle, Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

I felt that the programme last night gave a very one sided view about Ritalin. No, it is not the answer to all problems but it has been a life saver for my son. He has counselling and therapy and is so much happier than in the time before he started taking Ritalin when he couldn't understand what was wrong with him. He was very depressed and continually in trouble. At least now his self confidence is greater and he is not floundering at school. One other comment would be that for him Concerta did not work. If I was Craig's parents I would try different medication.

Sara Cocker, Remagen Germany

Whilst I thought this programme was very interesting and informative... And as a parent I have an open mind on this issue... I have a 12 year old son who has been on medication since 4 years old for ADHD. I am disappointed that you failed to show ANY of the 1000,s of success story's of this medication... I feel that you programme was extremely biased and one sided... Whilst the medication is clearly not working for Craig, it does work for many children and as responsible parents we want our children to be able to get a decent quality of education. I feel that a lot of parents due to your programme may now consider stopping medication wrongly, some of our children need this to survive in today's school environment!!! I enjoy your programme but this one disappointed me!

Sarah Boelema, Eastbourne, UK

I found it interesting that Craig was extremely verbally abusive towards his parents but not to the reporter when she spoke to him. He was able to control his temper when he wanted to (on camera anyway). Makes you wonder how much of it has to do with how much you let an ADHD child away with. I can understand that it would be easy to put everything down to the disorder.

Claire, Scotland

Panorama should be ashamed of themselves for showing such a one sided documentary on only 2 children. There are so many positive experiences of children on meds who lead much happier lives on Ritalin and that it worked well for them. Diazepam should never be given to a child with adhd so no wonder he reacted as he did, poor kid. I am very disappointed with the BBC, parents have a hard enough job as it is coping with this condition with out more negative media hype being added to it. You should bow your heads in shame.

Charlene, northants

I am so disappointed with this reporter and the producer of Panorama. This was not investigative journalism as Panorama purports to be; this was sensationalism with no attempt made to offer a balanced view. The facts are that adhd is under recognised in the UK and NICE recommends multimodal treatment of adhd i.e. medication along with behavioural support plus educational support to help the child achieve their potential; the last two are in very short supply if not non existent Nice is drawing up guidelines for those adults who never had their condition recognised in childhood but continue to suffer the consequences of this severely debilitating condition This reporter and the producer should be sacked. We pay our licence fee and expect proper balanced reporting not scaremongering at the expense of those who are unfortunate enough to suffer with this neuro biological condition. Very very poor programme; what are you going to do to redress the balance?

alison murray, newcastle england

I watched with interest the programme last night as I have two boys with adhd on Conserta, from Craigs outbursts and behaviour I saw a child who from my point of was not taking the medication, also downing coke full of sugar and additives could the diet be making his problems worse. I saw a one-sided story of the problems of children with adhd and it made me mad as a parent trying to make things better.

julie jubb, jersey channel islands

Congratulations! Ritalin should not be given to an adult let alone a child. I know I had to come off this type of drug.

If the public saw a real life Tricyclic/SSRI/Benzodiazepine withdrawal they would be appalled. They would never give this to a child. Withdrawal can go on in agony for years. It took me two years of fits ten times a day before life became bearable.

The general public and the doctors seem to think withdrawal is over in 7 to 28 days, The drugs maybe out of your system but the damage they have done to the nerve endings and liver lives on.

I was given this type of drug when my doctors thought I was malingering. They thought I was making up a stomach infection to get attention. Actually I had clostridium difficile. Vancomycin and tricyclics do not mix.

I had to do a major drug withdrawal. The full CT. No child should be put through this. Poor Craig. My heart bleeds for him. Never take a psychotic drug. Never trust your doctor and if you must always ask what the effects of the drug are. Is it addictive and what are the withdrawal effects? These can be horrific.

Only then, when you know all the facts you can make you choice but remember when you are throwing up at 6 am every morning for years that you were warned.

Congratulations on yesterday's Panorama programme about ADHD: ""What Next for Craig?""

Our family has been similarly misled by doctors' insistence on prescribing psychiatric drugs for another poorly-understood condition: autism.

The ruination of our autistic son's life started in 1992 when he was first prescribed psychiatric drugs in a residential care home at the age of 21.

It has long been our opinion that these drugs caused his deterioration which is seemingly permanent, because after first being prescribed them he became neurologically dependent on mood-altering drugs of one sort or another. He has failed to come off them due to experiencing further deterioration from withdrawals.

This downward cycle of cause and effect has been denied or ignored by all the medical professionals who've had dealings with our son since then. We assumed we would have to wait for another generation to be proved right by all the similar cases that would inevitably appear in time.

Last night's programme discredited the MTA Study into the effectiveness of drugs such as Ritalin, which experts had described as ""the best study done on planet earth."" Apart from ruining lives, these researchers and their paymasters are preventing honest medical and non-medical progress from taking place.

The Editors: Quizzing the home secretary,Newsbeat and 1Xtra listeners have been putting the home secretary on the spot.

We broadcast an interview with Jacqui Smith on the day the new crime figures came out - and not surprisingly for our young audience knife crime and cannabis were the big issues.

We asked five of our listeners to do the inquisition. We find this gets a very different and often more stimulating response than the journalist v politician style favoured elsewhere on BBC News.

Did she do well - or not? You can judge for yourselves by watching the video - and I'd love to hear your views:

In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed. Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions. If you're reading via RSS, you'll need to visit the blog to access this content.

The five Newsbeat and 1Xtra listeners spent more than 40 minutes grilling her. Afterwards, most of them said they were disappointed by the way she dealt with their concerns.

""I expected a text-book answer,"" said James Kennedy, a 28-year-old highways worker from Leicestershire, ""and that's exactly what I got. She treated us as if our opinions didn't count.""

Mechanic Adam Richardson, 27, from Bury St Edmunds, said, ""She didn't give a straight answer. She isn't someone I'd go for a drink down the pub with.""

Young mum Jodie from Crawley was also frustrated, saying, ""She just sat there gabbing on. By the time she'd finished, you'd forgot what she said because it wasn't directed at the questions that were asked.""

Jodie explained to the home secretary that she's frightened, because her younger brother goes out on the streets at night with a knife in his pocket. She said he carries a blade to protect himself.

And it's this point that was picked up by listeners to 1Xtra. Some echoed comments made by a contributor to Panorama's investigation into knife crime that there's a perception that jail terms for carrying blades are seldom enforced - and even if they are, time behind bars is preferable to being unarmed on dangerous streets.

Of those who contacted 1Xtra News afterwards, 80% were in favour of legalising cannabis. The argument that strong weed, such as skunk, is contributing to mental health problems was raised by the home secretary, who admitted she ""didn't know"" whether cannabis was more or less dangerous than alcohol. Radio 1's listeners couldn't agree on that either:

Adam said: ""I've been in trouble for getting in a fight when I was drunk. If I'd had a smoke, I would have avoided it. I've seen so many people become aggressive on alcohol."" An anonymous texter replied: ""I go out drinking in London every weekend and have never had a fight. I've seen much more damage done with people smoking weed. The mental health effects are massive also the fact that cannabis sales go towards much worse things.""

Adrian Luke, a 25-year-old from Bedford, told the home secretary that he needs to get a job or he risks going back to his old life of selling crack on the streets. He says he's spent 18 months in prison, and now he wants to stay straight. But he told Jacqui Smith, ""I need to support myself and my kids and my family. I'm very tempted to go back to doing what I was doing before"".

""I'm sympathetic to you, Adrian,"" she told him, ""because it sounds like you're really trying hard.""

Ripples from Article 50 ruling reach Parliament,A quiet week ahead? Not a bit of it. A statement on the High Court ruling requiring Parliamentary approval for the start of the Brexit process will highlight some MPs' and peers' attitudes.,"[""Mark D'Arcy"", 'Parliamentary Correspondent']",None,"Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption Gina Miller won her case at the High Court, challenging the government's intention to by-pass Parliament over the triggering of Article 50

It was supposed to be a quiet demi-week, leading to a mini-break for half term, but events, dear boy...

Last week MPs were being briefed that there would be no votes at all in the Commons, and there are still none, but the ripples from the High Court ruling to require Parliamentary approval for the start of the Brexit process, the triggering of the fabled Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, may draw them in.

The first splashes will come on Monday, with what promises to be a very interesting government statement in response. I'm not sure how much can be said by ministers with a live appeal process under way, but the mood music and the demeanour of the rival camps will be fascinating to behold.

And at some point in the week, another Brexit ripple may manifest in the Chamber, if the government moves fast to trigger the by-election to replace Stephen Phillips. Tory MPs will doubtless be ecstatic to be conscripted to be footsloggers, knocking on doors in the dark, in a by-election campaign in rural Lincolnshire, in January.

Meanwhile, the prospect that there will now have to be some kind of Brexit (Commencement) Bill, would certainly provide opportunities for Remainer mischief, not least because, as a constitutional measure, it would have to be considered in detail by a committee of the whole House, where diehard pro-EU MPs could catch it in a crossfire of hostile amendments and bog it down in the procedural mire.

But do they want to?

Many of the MPs who campaigned for Remain in June now insist that they have accepted the result and have switched their focus to the kind of Brexit the government should strive for. The chair of the new Brexit select committee, Labour's Hilary Benn, tells me on Today in Parliament, on Radio 4 tonight at 11.30pm, that he thinks it would be a mistake to clutter up a measure to trigger Article 50 with all kinds of caveats and conditions.

The real target of the proponents of ""soft Brexit"", or EU membership lite, is a bill that is yet to come; the promised Great Repeal Bill, which would pave the way for the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, and that is some way off.

So if the government does lose its Supreme Court appeal, the result might be a short carefully-drafted bill, to be launched into the Commons in January, put through all its formal stages of debate within a couple of weeks and passed through the Lords in good time for the government's self-imposed deadline of triggering Article 50 by March.

We will scrutinise. We will examine. But my Lords - we will not block Baroness Smith

While Lib Dem and SNP MPs might well conduct guerrilla operations, there would only be serious trouble if Labour decided to join in.... and with many Labour MPs surveying constituencies which voted emphatically for Leave, that may be problematic.

Nor does it seem likely that the House of Lords would seek to block the measure. To be sure, their lordships are even more pro-EU than MPs, but they have a fine sense of the limits they can push. Here I take as my text a speech made by Baroness Smith of Basildon, Labour's leader in the Upper House, on how her party would approach Brexit:

""We will use the expertise and knowledge in this House to fully understand the implications of Brexit, to advise the Government and to do whatever we can to ensure that these issues are effectively addressed, both through our highly regarded EU Committees and on the floor of Your Lordships House. We will scrutinise. We will examine. But my Lords - we will not block. But neither will we be bullied into abdicating our responsibilities. We have to be adult about this. We can't have the most enthusiastic Brexiters crying foul every time Parliament asks for more details or seeks to scrutinise.""

Again, the considerable bloc of Lib Dem Lords might attempt a guerrilla campaign, but again they would normally need Labour support to have any real impact. And if Labour stick by Baroness Smith's words, they would need to attract a freelance army of pro-EU Labour peers, plus a fair number of crossbenchers and Conservatives - a tall order.

But all that's for the future; here's my rundown of the week ahead.

Monday

The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Defence questions, after which the government has already announced a statement on the High Court ruling that Parliament has to approve the triggering of the Article 50 process to leave the EU - and this will probably be the major parliamentary event of this truncated week.

There may also be other ministerial statements or urgent questions, before the House moves on to a general debate on Exiting the EU and workers' rights.

The adjournment debate, led by the former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is on Midland Mainline electrification - a major regional issue. Electrification was promised by the then Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, in 2012, but now there is talk that it may be postponed because of cost over-runs on work elsewhere in the network. Expect a show of strength by MPs with constituencies along the line from London to Sheffield, not least because many in the Eat Midlands believe they will get very little benefit from HS2, which runs through the region, and could end up depending on the last inter-city line not to have electrification.

And continuing the railway theme, my committee pick (from a rather thin field, be it admitted) is the Transport Committee hearing (4.05pm) on rail franchising, where the star witness is Rail Minister Paul Maynard, who is due on at 4.55pm, unless he is delayed by late running.

In the Lords (2.30pm), what looks likely to be a very quick rubber stamping committee stage for the Labour peer Baroness Young of Hornsey's Modern Slavery (Transparency in Supply Chains) Bill tops the agenda. Her bill would ban public contracting authorities from using an economic operator that has no produced a slavery and human trafficking statement.

Then peers turn to their second committee stage day on the Wales Bill - last week I flagged that three Welsh Labour heavyweights, former Welsh secretaries Peter Hain and Paul Murphy, plus their former leader, Neil Kinnock wanted to delete the clause that would amend the Wales Act 2014 to remove the requirement for there to be a referendum in advance of the devolution of a portion of income tax.

In other words, they think there should be a referendum before any income tax powers are devolved - unusually, they plan to hold a vote on that amendment.

The Lords didn't get that far down the agenda, because other business intruded - and I'm not sure it will come up this time, with debate likely to focus on the ""reservations"" - policy areas that would be retained at Westminster.

Tuesday

The Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. Expect plenty of probing around the Nissan deal. That's followed (unless a statement or urgent question intrudes) by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Adrian Bailey. His Small and Medium Sized Co-operative Development Bill calls for small but important changes to reduce the burden of audit requirements on small co-ops, and bring them into line with those for other kinds of company.

The day's main debates are on subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - on the role of grammar and faith schools and on raising awareness of a new generation of veteran and service personnel.

In Westminster Hall (9.30am-11am) there's a debate on disability hate crime - where the key focus will be on whether the prosecuting authorities take it seriously enough. The responsible minister is the Solicitor-General, Robert Buckland, and his Labour shadow is Nick Thomas Symonds - the two have been sparring partners since they began their careers at neighbouring Cardiff legal practices.

Mr Buckland says the issue has been a priority and that prosecution numbers are starting to creep up, albeit from a very low base. The debate will also focus on sentencing levels for these offences and whether they are adequate, and may also move onto disability ""mate"" crime, where individuals ""befriend"" people with a disability and then steal from them or abuse them.

Another one to watch is Anna Turley's debate (4.30pm-5.30pm) on sentencing for animal cruelty, an issue she has been pursuing since a particularly distressing case in her constituency; she has a private members bill on the issue, due for debate in February.

On the committee corridor the Education Committee has a promising-looking hearing, (9.45am) reviewing the evidence base allowing new grammar schools and extending selective education. The Department for Education, academics and policy experts will weigh in, with Minister for School Standards, Nick Gibb, and Dr Tim Leunig, Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department for Education responding.

The Culture Media and Sport Committee (10.30am) has a hearing on homophobia in sport - with John Amaechi, the first NBA basketball star to come out as gay, Olympian race-walker Tom Bosworth; international rugby union referee Nigel Owens (via video link, at 11.30am) and footballer Lianne Sanderson (via video link, at noon).

In the Lords, there are a couple of interesting points to watch out for in the second report stage day on the Children and Social Work Bill, where Labour look set to force a vote to prevent local authorities being able to opt out of children's social care legislation to 'test' new ways of working or to privatise key services; the government may face yet another defeat.

The second issue is on the safeguarding of unaccompanied refugee children where the minister, Edward Timpson, has offered a package of 'safeguarding' measures to prevent Labour Peer Lord Dubs from inflicting a further defeat.

The dinner break business is a Lib Dem regret motion against a statutory instrument on the benefit cap for housing benefit and Universal Credit.

Wednesday

The Commons is in recess - but the Lords plough on.

The subjects at question time range across problems faced by carers in accessing primary and community support services, controlling Japanese knotweed and placing children in local authority care close to their extended family and current school.

The day's main business is further committee stage debate on the Policing and Crime Bill - the debates will cover clauses on licensing and gambling, anti-doping, alcohol limits, posthumous pardons, pre-charge anonymity and the Victims Code.

During the lunch break, there will be a short debate on the report of the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman on unsafe discharge from hospital.","['50', 'ripples', 'bill', 'house', 'committee', 'mps', 'lords', 'ruling', 'issue', 'brexit', 'labour', 'education', 'article', 'parliament', 'reach', 'debate']","The first splashes will come on Monday, with what promises to be a very interesting government statement in response.

How to help an alcoholic,,['Denise Winterman'],2006-08-30 11:52:01,"By Denise Winterman

BBC News Magazine



Kennedy admitted his problem

Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and his close confidantes wrestled long and hard with whether to go public about his drink problem, according to a new book. But is there a correct way to help an alcoholic?

At what point does having a drink become a drink problem, and when do you tackle the person about it?

Accusations in a new book that Liberal Democrats MPs knew of former leader Charles Kennedy's drink problem for years have resulted in the party being accused of conspiring to cover it up.

The book claims Mr Kennedy already had a serious drink problem when he became party leader in 1999, but only publicly admitted it in January this year.

""It was very difficult... Of course, with hindsight, one can see it was a serious problem for a long period but it wasn't evident in the same way at the time,"" says Lib Dem MP Matthew Taylor, who was Mr Kennedy's leadership campaign manager in 1999.

Supportive atmosphere

But what should the Lib Dems have done? The case echoes a dilemma that will be familiar to many in the workplace and in homes across the UK. How do you handle someone with a drink problem and what advice, if any, should be given to them?

The party took a sensitive approach and says it ""quite properly"" sought to protect Mr Kennedy's privacy. Going in all guns blazing would have been destructive, instead they tried to create a constructive atmosphere for Mr Kennedy to open up about the problem, says Andrew McNeill, director of Institute of Alcohol Studies.

The allegations are in a new book

""Covering up for someone is not a help, a conspiracy of silence does no one any good. In many cases the people working or living with an alcoholic try to help for years and just end up enabling them to drink.""

There is a very fine line between helping and making the problem worse, says Maureen Smith, whose 37-year-old son is a recovering alcoholic.

""You try to help them and protect them by giving emotional security, you feed them and clothe them,"" she says. ""But often you create an environment where the only thing they have to worry about is alcohol.

""If people are doing the same for them at work, often they will be able to function in a relatively normal way despite still drinking heavily.""

Rock bottom

Trying to help is also made harder by the fact that a drink problem takes many forms, some more severe than others. In Mr Kennedy case he was functioning normally much of the time. This would have made it easier for him to have assured his Lib Dem colleagues that he was tackling the problem.

""Alcoholics can be very remorseful, they can go through long periods of not drinking,"" says former alcoholic Samuel Williams, 38.

""For those trying to help them it can be easy to accept their excuses when they fall off the wagon yet again. In Mr Kennedy's case it would have taken a strong person to question him and out him in public.""

Alcoholics have to want help

""In the end I had to walk away from my son, then stand back and watch him sink further into alcoholism,"" says Mrs Smith. ""It was the hardest thing I have had to do, but it was only when he hit rock bottom that he decided he needed help.""

And that is the crux of helping anyone with a drink problem, says Mr Williams.

""The drinker has to take responsibility for themselves and want to get help. Despite what some people think stopping doesn't come down to willpower - alcoholism is an addiction and there is no reasoning with an addiction.

""I, and many others, would be over the moon if there was a fool-proof way to get people to admit their problem and then work through it. There isn't.

""That isn't very encouraging for those dealing with an alcoholic but it doesn't mean they should stop trying. Often it is only with the help of others that someone can face up to what they are doing.""

I know that I have a drinking problem, though have not looked for help. I like to convince myself that I can handle it but when I'm sober I know I can't. I've drunk nothing for three days now and am trying to last a week, but experience tells me I probably won't. I know that I should seek help, but don't feel ready to at the moment. What I do know, is that the worst thing that people can do is mention it. My parents know I'm a heavy drinker and the worst thing they can do is mention it. All it does is make me defensive, depressed and I drink to console meself. It's a horrible situation.

Anon, Anon

Yes, but there are damned few services available for those who do need help. Most of the funding goes towards drug treatment, very little towards alcohol abuse. My ex-wife became alcohol dependent nearly 3 years ago, and despite constant attempts to get help and/or treatment, the waiting lists were over 8 months for an initial assessment. No wonder she has fallen through the net. We needed help, but 'care in the community' has failed us. The only other option is a 16-week private residential placement at over £1000 per week. Ludicrous!

David, Exeter

The term that is used to describe supporting and protecting someone with an alcohol problem is ""enabling"" and sadly many loving families and caring colleagues are guilty of it. Alcoholism, though very hard to deal with, is not a disease. This idea is what convinces many people with alcohol problems that they cannot help themselves. The best way to deal with it, and I speak as someone who has worked with these people, is to teach them to drink alcohol responsibly. Then all the glamour and mystique of being in the grip of something uncontrollable goes away.

tanya, UK

Having an alcoholic in the family is tough. Advising and aiding do little good unless that person wishes to change their lifestyle. As failed diplomacy leads to war, so the failure of loving and supporting families should resort to the equivalent. Tough Love. Stop supporting them, you will always be concerned and worried but without too much support, when life gets too tough, the person will realise they HAVE to change for their families as well as for themselves. Carson.

Carson, Cadiz, Spain

The Liberal Democrats were in an indiuous position vis-a-via Charles Kennedy's alcohol addiction. When they supported him they are are accused of ""covering up"". When they decide they cannot continue to do this and force him out of the leadership, they are accused of ""betrayal"". But what else could they have done?

Geoff Payne, London, England

I would welcome anything that will help alcoholics. Unfortunately any help will be too late for me who, at 27 will not have my father to give me away when I get married or be able to take my children to see their grandfather. No amount of begging or pleading with him to stop or cut down made a scrap of difference and it was almost as if he accepted the fact that alcohol would eventually kill him. Alcohol cost my father his marriage and ultimately cost him his life. If any help can be given so those in similar situations do not have to suffer the same heartache that I and many others have then at least it would be a small comfort.

I admire Charles Kennedy for admitting his drink problem, i feel that once he addmitted it, the party should of got behind him and let him sort out his problem and leave the door open for him to return, the problem should be dropped and carry on, we the public don't need to know the inside story on it, he and his party are on the political stage and thats all we should know about, he has admitted it, now move on

Marcus Lilley , Marlborough UK

And the problem is getting steadily worse. It is time that we, as a society, accepted that alcohol is a drug - a drug that is becoming relatively cheaper and ever more freely available in so many shopping outlets. It has taken many years for the dangers associated with tobacco to be taken seriously. The sooner we start doing the same with alcohol - the better it will be for all of us.

Mary Harrington, Crosby, Liverpool, UK

Alcolholism has caused major problems in my life - very destructive prolems. My sister died in my arms in hospital in 1997 due to alcolhol abuse - she wouldn't accept help until it was too late. It also destroyed my relationship with my partner during 2000 - 2002. He just would not stop drinking until he got into so much debt that he had to curtail drinking. It seems that persons cannot accept help from those who love them - and boy oh boy does alcoholism hurt those that love them.

Rod, Porthleven

There is so much help advertised for nicotine addicts, but not for alcohol addicts. The stigma attached to being addicted to alcohol puts many off admitting a problem and seeking help.

M, Nottingham

In my opinion, it is of no use at all nagging an alcoholic, he will do something about it in his own way. It is a disease of the body , the mind and the spirit and is a killer, I joined aa 37 years ago and found a sober life style and their programme works if you want it to. Help is there for those who want it! Good luck to Charles!

Drink problems are medical problems. Like other medical problems they should be treated with professionalism, empathy and understanding, predjudice should be avoided. Like all other chronic conditions social and psycological support is necessary for both patient and dependants. Respect all people; that's the only answer! Paul

Paul, London

My husband died from alcoholism at a young age, never acknowledging he had a problem. I have since worked with alcoholics and realise that I was enabling him by not going public, although i tried to get him help. The addict has to admit their problem and want to recover.

Kathy Heath, Crawley UK

We have someone at work with the very same problem. It affects us all because he is always off sick, and the MD just accepts that this person is just a sickly person. How can it be acceptable for an MD to allow a person to consume 2-3 pints during a lunchtime, and then come back to work. Once the MD has left, a can of stella arrives on the desk, and office drinking is full on. This person is often off sick after a night out, and it just gets washed under the carpet ! Its one rule for the Alcoholic and andother rule for everyone else. Alcoholism in the workplace affects everyone !

ML, Bristol England

Unfortunately it's rarely just a case of 'putting the drink down' for those unfortunate's attempting to stop abusing alcohol, in many cases full lifestyle reviews are required. It's a learned behaviour that somehow has to be ""un-learnt"" over a significant time-span. Those looking to help and understand someone with a drink problem should prepare for a difficult and sometimes perplexing journey ahead. I speak from experience, having had a drink problem myself.

John, Scarborough, North Yorkshire

Many roads lead to alcoholism as they do to other addictions. Yes, the alcoholic must admit to the problem but there is also a need to understand and deal with the underlying cause/s which led to addiction in the first place.

Martin Davis, Twickenham, England

As a recovering person who just celebrated 24 years of sobriety, I can tell you that Alcoholic Anonymous is not for people who need it, but want it.

Pat M., Springfield, IL US

I became an alcoholic after a car accident and being made redundant, it took me 5 or 6 years to realise I had a drink problem and then another 12 months to come to terms with that. I locked myself in the house got rid of every alcoholic drink I could find and dried out - a horrible vile time, shaking sweating not being able to sleep, it took a couple of years before I could be around alocohol again. I lost most of my friends but I haven't had a drink in nine years.

Wayne Turner, St Helens, Merseyside

after refusing to admit that a bottle of vodka a day was a drink problem, i left my partner after 3 years of abuse, as soon as i went he used the fact i'd left as the reason he drank, it was always someone elses fault. He died at the age of 32 still refusing to admit he had a problem. The only people who could give me the support i needed were al anon and i would recommend them to anyone who is the relative or friend of an alcholic

"The ex-governor, the candidate, his wife and her ex","Virginia ex-Governor Bob McDonnell may face prison for corruption. Star Texas Democrat Wendy Davis faces questions about her past. For both, a spouse seems to hold the key.","['Anthony Zurcher', 'Editor', 'Echo Chambers']",None,"The ex-governor, the candidate, his wife and her ex

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has been accused of putting ambition ahead of family

One was a leader in the Republican Party, reported to be on the short list for a vice-presidential nomination in 2012. The other is a rising star among Democrats, who in less than a year has gone from a little-known state senator to a high-profile campaign for governor.

Now, former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell is under indictment for corruption, his reputation in shambles. And Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has found that her rise to fame has brought harsh scrutiny, as she is forced to explain discrepancies in details of her past.

The two politicians' stories may seem quite different, but they have a common thread in the role of spouses in politics and life.

Fall from grace

First, Mr McDonnell. His legal fate has been tied inextricably to that of his wife, Maureen. She was indicted alongside him, and the court documents dwell in detail on her attempts to have a wealthy donor buy her a dress for the gubernatorial inauguration and a $6,000 Rolex watch for her husband.

Remember: when men are extravagant it's manly Dahlia Lithwick, Slate

The Washington Post's Petula Dvorak writes that the heart of the story is Ms McDonnell's vanity.

""She comes from a humble background and worked hard as a stay-at-home mom, with occasional forays into home-based businesses such as vitamin supplements and teddy bear sales,"" Dvorak writes. ""She was a Redskins cheerleader who married a football guy. He proposed in a parking lot. It was a life that didn't exactly polish her for the world of politics and Ladies Who Lunch.""

Ms McDonnell's ""misjudgement and taste for luxury"" contributed to the governor's downfall, writes the New York Times' Trip Gabriel.

He quotes Republican political consultant Kellyanne Conway on how jealousy can take hold in political spouses: ""There is the resentment of one person being in the spotlight and the other picking up Cheerios off the floor in her husband's college sweatshirt night after night.""

Politico's Alexander Burns and John F Harris write that Mr McDonnell has been portrayed as a dupe: ""A well-intentioned man, pure of heart but weak in dealing with the people around him, led cluelessly into dangerous legal territory by an acquisitive and ill-tempered wife - Lady Macbeth with an Amex card.""

All of this has Slate's Dahlia Lithwick crying foul:

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ex-Governor Robert McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, have been charged with corruption

The implication that it was the former NFL cheerleader and her quest for designer shoes and gowns that brought the McDonnells down is kind of a journalistic chip shot... But the truth is that McDonnell was just as profligate and greedy as his wife, and the indictment proves it. So why is his own fondness for racking up exorbitant golf expenses relegated to the last disembodied paragraph of the Times piece? Is it because in the hierarchy of political greed, golfing, and private jets rank as legitimate expenses whereas couture dresses and shoes are foolish? Remember: When men are extravagant it's manly. When women do it, it's tacky.

A questioned past

The story of Wendy Davis, in a way, is a mirror image of Mr McDonnell's. Whereas with Mr McDonnell the spouse was being used to bludgeon the politician, in this case it is Ms Davis's ex-husband who is being held up as too good for her.

The story began several weeks ago, when a Dallas Morning News profile of the Texas Democrat noted some discrepancies between reality and the single-mom, pulled-herself-up-from-poverty story she presented. Her conservative critics pounced.

Here's a news flash: people who run for office are typically ambitious Kirsten Powers, The Daily Beast

She was 21, not 19, when she divorced her first husband. She only lived for a few months in a trailer park with her daughter before moving back in with her mother. And the focus of conservative fire: she did not work her way through college and Harvard Law School on her own; she remarried and her husband cashed in his retirement savings to help pay her tuition.

While Ms Davis was at Harvard, her husband stayed back in Dallas to look after their children. The couple would later divorce - shortly after Ms Davis's student loans had been paid off, her ex-husband said - and Mr Davis was given custody of the two daughters, by then in college and high school.

""The truth is less coal-miner's daughter than gold-digger who found a sugar daddy to raise her kids and pay for her education,"" writes conservative commentator Ann Coulter. ""If someone else is taking care of your kids and paying your tuition, that's not amazing.""

She suggested that maybe Mr Davis should be the one running for governor: ""He's the one who raised two kids, including a stepdaughter, while holding down a job and paying for his wife's law school. There's a hard-luck story!""

Syndicated columnist Mona Charen says Ms Davis's situation is an indictment of liberal ideology:

This false heroic tale is a common trope on the left these days - women doing it all by themselves. It's more than partisan hackery. It reinforces the very damaging notion that women don't need husbands. Many, many women are swallowing this propaganda and acting on it. They, their children and our society are suffering mightily as a result.

The New York Post's Naomi Schaefer Riley thinks that the new information will be poison to Ms Davis's political career.

""Who could resist the siren call of the Ivy League?"" she writes. ""Well, I suspect that most women and plenty of men would, if it meant moving across the country from their kids for three years… Americans will forgive a lot in a politician. But a woman who leaves her kids is just beyond the pale.""

Davis's defenders

Unlike Mr McDonnell, who has seen erstwhile friends and allies abandon him now that his power is gone, Ms Davis has drawn defenders from across the left.

The Daily Beast's Kirsten Powers writes that Ms Davis's treatment by conservative critics represents a double-standard - both in how they view men versus women and how they judge Democrats versus Republicans:

Here's a news flash: people who run for office are typically ambitious. But only with women is ambition treated as something shameful.

The double standard is reminiscent of how Sarah Palin was treated when she chose to run for vice president in 2008. Her candidacy set off a controversy about whether she was neglecting her children, in particular her special-needs baby. Back then, conservatives were the ones mostly defending her and expressing outrage that anyone would question her decision. Now they see attacking a woman's parenting choices as fair game.

The criticism of Ms Davis, writes syndicated columnist Connie Schultz, echoes the campaign against the last Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, whose divorce and treatment for alcoholism were used in an anonymous letter-writing campaign to call her ""an unfit wife and mother"".

As for the view that the revelations will damage Ms Davis's political career, Salon's Carolyn Edgar thinks that it comes from an outdated view of how husbands and wives work together.

Wendy Davis, the feminist hero, is reduced to playing the role of victim, victimized by her own fabrications being confronted with truth Erick Erickson, RedState blog

""The financial and emotional support Davis received from her second husband, Jeff, is the type of support most people in committed relationships expect from their partners, and hardly counts as gold digging,"" she writes.

She continues:

Davis' post-divorce relationship with Jeff Davis is an encouraging example of the type of co-parenting relationship most of us single mothers hope to have with our children's fathers. The feminization of Jeff Davis as ""a better single mother than Wendy Davis"" reflects a level of blindness to the ways that modern parenting has changed from traditional norms.

Ms Davis's two daughters have also come forward to say that they never felt their mother abandoned them.

'Abortion Barbie'

The National Review's Andrew Stiles writes that liberals are trying to change the subject: ""Rather than address the actual discrepancies in Davis's 'rags to riches' narrative, her liberal supporters have devoted most of their energy to blasting her critics as sexist foot-soldiers in the Republican party's 'war on women.'""

Ms Davis gained national prominence when she stood for hours on the floor of the Texas legislature to block a state law increasing regulation of abortion clinics and banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. For this RedState blog's Erick Erickson nicknamed her ""Abortion Barbie"" - and he was quick to weigh in against the liberal pushback.

""Instead of simply declaring her story exaggerated, the left is claiming Davis is being held to a double standard or they are simply screaming sexism,"" he writes. ""Wendy Davis, the feminist hero, is reduced to playing the role of victim, victimized by her own fabrications being confronted with truth.""

The vehemence with which Erickson has condemned Ms Davis (including tweeting ""she's so cute when she's lying"") has created some splits on the right, however.

Fox News host Greta Van Susteran writes on her blog: ""I don't care how much you disagree or agree with Texas' Wendy Davis, you have to agree that this guy, Erick Erickson, is a real jerk and is really lousy at being a spokesperson for his views.""

The campaign for governor in Texas is still in its early stages, and the jury is still out on whether the recent furore will affect Ms Davis's chances. She was considered a long-shot from the start, so anything that takes her off-message could prove debilitating. The Democrat has capitalised on her national name recognition to raise more than $10m (£6m), however, which means her candidacy will have the funds to make major investments in voter outreach and television advertising.

Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell has also been fundraising - for a legal defence team that will help him try to avoid a prison sentence.

Zambia's celebrity couple reveal wife-beating past,,['Jo Fidgen'],2009-11-30 07:45:33,"

By Jo Fidgen

BBC News, Lusaka

One of Zambia's most famous singers has revealed how she was badly beaten by her husband. She now hopes to lift the lid on the country's ingrained acceptance of domestic violence. ""My husband will kill me,"" giggles Saboi Imboela nervously. ""But, yes, he once beat me up so badly I reported him to the police."" The 32-year old is one of Zambia's top vocalists. Her husband is a popular actor, Owas Ray Mwape. This is the first time she has spoken publicly about the beating she received at his hands, and she wriggles uncomfortably at the memory. The majority of women enjoy a beating, because they are made to believe it is part of our tradition

Christine Kalamwina

Gender in Development Director ""It was the police who begged me not to take it further,"" she recalls, revealing some of the engrained attitudes she is now taking on. ""They told me: 'We know how you women are. We'll lock him up and in a minute or two, you'll change your mind and want him released.'"" Her doctor also dissuaded her from reporting the assault, as did some of her friends. 'Part of growing up' Campaigners believe more than half of Zambian women have suffered domestic abuse but cases rarely come to light because of the stigma attached to speaking out. Young women are taught by their elders to accept punishment from their husbands when they are disobedient. Even cooking a bad meal warrants a smack. Many women fear divorce would leave them in penury ""That's how you grow up in Africa,"" explains Mr Mwape. ""To be a man, you need to discipline a woman, give her a slap or two. You know, in our culture, it's OK because that's how we feel we love our women."" It is a message driven home at boys' initiation ceremonies - chastisement is a sign of affection and a woman never achieves the status of an adult. Like a child she needs to be ""trained"" to behave well. In some parts of the country tradition allows a man to beat his wife if he survives a crocodile attack. In others, a wife's infidelity is revealed when her newborn baby coughs. She must take the consequences. ""Tradition is used as a cover for domestic violence,"" complains Johnson Tembo. As chairman of the Men's Network, he tries to persuade his peers to alter their behaviour. But he believes women's attitudes need to change too. ""Some women are foolish enough to think that if they are not beaten by their husbands, they're not loved,"" he says. Marital-rape clause It is a problem recognised by the Zambian government's Gender in Development Division. Director Christine Kalamwina is forthright about the challenges she faces in tackling domestic abuse. ""The majority of women enjoy a beating, because they are made to believe it is part of our tradition,"" she says. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. She believes the answer is to create awareness that violence against women is discrimination. ""Then they can stand up and claim their rights,"" she says. Those rights are being discussed with the drafting of an anti-domestic violence bill. As it stands, the law does not recognise attacks on women as a specific crime. Cases are treated as simple assault. But the bill, which is designed to change that, is already running into difficulties. A clause outlawing marital rape has been dropped because of cultural considerations. And Ms Kalamwina says it is proving hard to reach agreement on where to draw the line between courtship rituals and sexual harassment in a country where women are expected to play hard to get. 'Partner or doormat?' But even if the law is tightened, would it make a difference? The risks of taking a stand against domestic violence are too great for many women. They are often blamed for provoking their husbands and ostracised for exposing them. I was ready to go jail for what I did; I deserved it

Owas Ray Mwape Divorce may follow, with devastating consequences. ""Abused women tell us they don't want their relationships to break up because the husband is the bread-winner, and they won't be able to take care of their children,"" says Hope Kasese Kumalo, the acting national co-ordinator for Woman and Law in Southern Africa. ""There's a lot of glorification of marriage in this country,"" she says. ""Some women who are economically independent will not speak out against violence because they want to stay married at all costs. ""If you are married you are respected; if you are not, people will think there is something wrong with you."" A battered woman who runs to her parents is often sent back to her abusive husband. Campaigners are now hoping to revolutionise women's rights Fortunately, not all cases end badly. At home in Lusaka, Ms Imboela and Mr Mwape snuggle up on the sofa together. ""He's a good husband, we've sorted out our differences,"" smiles Ms Imboela. Mr Mwape counts himself lucky. ""I was ready to go jail for what I did; I deserved it. I have stopped hitting my wife for the sake of our boys. I don't want them to become what I became,"" he says. ""I'm pleased Saboi has spoken about this. That's the way to go."" Is he worried about his reputation? ""No, I don't have concerns that people will think less of me now, because in Zambia, 99.9% of men have committed that crime before,"" he says. Ms Imboela is now working on a song about women's rights, called Yenze Nthawi Yakayena (That Was Then). ""Men have always mistreated their wives. But times have changed, and men must too,"" she sings. She says she hopes abused women will hear her song and ""stand up and say: 'This is wrong'. ""And that men will look at their situation and say: 'I love my wife and I shouldn't treat her like this. She's my partner, not my doormat',"" she says. Thanks for your comments. Please read a selection below: The long and short of all of this is that it is not acceptable to beat anyone. Simple. As adults we are free to behave as we please with in the realms of law. If one has a spouse who behaves in a manner one finds unacceptable then the truth is you married the wrong person. Remove yourself and save further heart ache if you can't sit down, talk and come to an acceptable compromise. A man who beats a woman is, let's face it, weak and lacks self control and possibly has latent mental health issues (being unable to control ones own actions in anger is in fact a mental health problem) If you love a person you don't want to see them hurt talk less of inflict hurt. This is a global issue and does not relate specifically to culture. The article above is very poor and the couple should really re-assess what they have said. 'My husband will kill me' giggled Soboi as though it's a laughing matter. Disgusting.

Fola, London I am a Zambian woman from the same tribe as Mr Mwape. That is certainly not how we grow up in Zambia. Mr Mwape should speak for himself. Most Zambians find it totally unacceptable to beat your wife or any woman and no civilised Zambian would condone it in anyway. There are no excuses. We have a beautiful, rich culture and this is definitely not part of it.

Musonda, London, UK Owas does not speak for any Zambian culture. There is no Zambian culture that encourages a man to beat a woman. I think its time we stopped hiding behind culture.

Monica Chalawila, Zambia I am a Zambian traditionalist from the same tribe as Mr Owas Ray Mwape, who must be the northern part of Zambia i Believe. Wife battering is totally unacceptable in this day and era even in the Zambian culture. Young men and women who are about to get married are taught to resolve their differences amicably, mostly by calling on marriage counsellors. Each party has a marriage counsellor and it is totally unacceptable for Mr Mwape to justify his actions.

Emmanuel chota, lusaka, ZAMBIA @Frank from Kampala. i am disgusted by your advice to men that when women are arrogant etc they should be lightly woken up. I have a master degree in engineering and i am a white British woman. I was with a Nigerian man for a number of years supporting him entirely with my wage whilst he sat at home working the occasional night. he did not clean house or cook for me. does that mean i should have lightly woken him up for not doing what i expected when i was the main bread winner by over 50,000 pounds sterling????? Please don't be so utterly ridiculous. Authority and leadership is not defined by gender, and punishment and discipline should not be meted out by either man or woman!!! Get with the times and stop insulting everyone with your horrendously backwards perspective

Anonymous I come from the Eastern part of Angola. And the Lunda-Tchokwe do not in any way tolerate or allow wife beating. In fact in our culture, you could lose your wife as her brothers or Uncle will simply walk in and walk away with her. It is a very expensive and complicated procedure to have her back in your home. It could be true that some societies in Zambia tolerate wife beating but then Zambia is not Africa. We are a diverse society with different cultures and among our many cultures in Lunda-Tchokwe, it does not include wife beating.

Mario Zacarias, North Dakota I do not think it's a cultural thing. Women should rather look for ""responsible"" men rather than cheap losers. As a man, I saw my father cook in the house with my mom and no arguments over chores or what to do. In some cases of spousal abuse, some women fell victims due to their choice. What do you expect of a guy who sags his pants and do drugs? They see responsible young men and go about chasing a man with history of anger and abuse. Tell me what you expect in their home? At the same time, women also abuse men only that the guys do not complain due to the societal influence. Who will you tell if your wife slapped you or beat you up?

Bod, Edmonton, Canada Nice contributions. What cause(s) wife battering - 'I ll show u am the man of this house irrespective of your status"". Pls dont be deceived man is created as the head & contesting this fact is the singular causative agent. Our women should learn how to obey God's injuction concerning marriage i.e submit yourself to him PROVIDED what he is demanding is Honest, Legitimate & Godly. Summarily any man that beat his wife should either be taken to asylum or better still zoo bcos that is d place he can enjoy d liberty of lawlessness. How can a sane man be beating himself(for the Two are One). All it requires is Understanding, Patience & Prayer

Adepomola Kayode, Ibadan I am an Eritrean and grew up often been smack by my parents and I have no regrets to that. However recently I was badly hurt by my own husband who is suppose to protect and love me, specially as we are in diaspora and I took short cut to leave because no words, gifts or change of behaviour can heal the pain and the humiliation I felt. A man who heats a woman is no a man, but a weak and unsecure kind.

Nisbah, Germany many seems to look violence from the men angle alone but some women cant control themselves, any little thing they bounce on the man tearing his clothes, using her nails on him , throwing things at him, what do you expect from such men if they have to defend themselves. some women are just troublesome.

david, london women must stop moving out with other men..everytime coming late drunk..these beatings are ok..but men dont beat too much..just slap

francis, russia I am a Canadian black woman. I spent about two years in a relationship with a Nigerian man, who was also 14 years my senior. He definitely had some control issues and got very aggravated when I would question his values, whereabouts, or integrity. We had an incident where I was attacked by him and the police did become involved... it was an embarrassing and sad experience for both of us. This man had been in Canada for over 20 years, but I certainly sensed strong cultural values and beliefs that stem from his upbringing. I believe that our relationship would have been very abusive, had we of lived in Nigeria for example, where woman's rights are neglected - to say the least! It is sad to say, but from the things that he shared with me I am convinced that woman in certain parts of Africa (and many other countries around the world)have been socially constructed to accept a second class status in society. The things he shared with me about Nigerian society lead me to believe that it is not accepted for woman in Nigeria to question a man at any time or regarding anything. In fact, he actually told me that if I were in Nigeria that the women there would teach me ""my place."" I have since left this relationship and learned a valuable lesson. When a man can not respect you as an equal and deserving woman, no matter the culture, than he has issues with himself that will only change with self reflection and self actualization... YOU CANNOT CHANGE HIM! I am highly disturbed by the number of women who are abused and nothing is done about it. Women stand up for you self respect, and find a love that is true, because you are worth it!

MJ, Canada A woman is a person, she should not be treated differently from a man in the household (or most other places). Two partners can split chores as they see fit, but never under any circumstances does a man have a right to lay a hand to her. Men would never stand for women beating them when they disagree or are flatulent or slovenly, so why would anyone ever think the reverse is acceptable?

Olivia, Travelling, The World Well, has anyone looked at their own country lately? I live in the US and constantly see ads on television advising young women who are being beaten by their boy friends to inform their parents or elders, it is an epidemic. Daily there are articles in the papers about women having sought an ""order of protection"" against their spouse or significant other. Some have been shot, not just beaten, shot in the street, chased with gun drawn... even the children are now getting killed with the spouse. Here I find the BBC talking about some misguided ""singer"" and her ""actor"" husband, and the conclusion drawn is African culture condones ""wife beating"". I never fail to be amazed at the blanket statements thrown around about Africans and African culture. I guess the fact that no-one ever really challenges these false statements makes all that one hears about ""African culture"" true. Exactly what is ""African culture""? There a myriads of traditional beliefs by more variations on the definition of an African than any other. This is all part of the freedom that is felt by the alleged ""civilized world"" to say and do anything to Africa and Africans. One gets so fed up and tired.

dora brown, New York NY ""That's how you grow up in Africa,"" explains Mr Mwape. I am getting tired of people like Mr Mwape who treat customs in their little corner of Africa as being representative of the entire continent. For a start Africa is a continent not a country; I grew up having the honour of knowing marriage life between my grandparents; parents and other family members and never did I ever see any of the men lift a hand against their wives. I am 32 years and wife beating is not a norm and it's frowned upon and just like the western society a few bad nuts will still do it. That does not mean it is an accepted practice. Wake up and stop giving a Africa a bad name; Africans are civilized and it's about time this was passed across by the western media and their mouth pieces like Mr Mwape...

Malcolm, Ealing UK What people have to realize is that there is no ""African"" culture. Every tribe has its own tradition and Africa as a whole is more culturally diverse than Europe. So a phrase like ""That's how you grow up in Africa"" makes no sense. And as countries do not always match tribes (thanks to European drawn maps), the tradition can vary largely even within the same country.

Patrick, Montreal, Canada this article is completely misleading and as a result leads to incorrect perceptions of African and the romanticising of our culture. like anything else there are a few that give the rest of us a bad name but i am yet to meet a man who thinks that beating his wife is a way of showing love.

joe, glasgow, scotland I do not think any good culture will promote beating of a woman. I am not married yet, but sometimes when I have misunderstanding with my girl friend, the worst I do is to take a walk and when I return, we look at each other and smile. I want to correct those referring to ""this is how we do in Africa"". The fact that you do it in Zambia does not represent the rest of other 52 African countries. We in my place were trained to respect women, not only women but people. Violence in whatever guise is discouraged and it's criminal. This is the way we do in Africa is a stupid excuse for perpetrating violence against innocent women and children. I will implore African countries that have not legislated this criminal act to do so and bring the perpetrators to book.

Yomi, Portugal It is regrettable that the barbaric practice of spousal abuse can be deemed a way of life in Zambia. Nothing could be further from the truth, I am certain that a more in depth analysis would have illustrated that the vast majority of Zambian men do not condone violence against women. To us it's considered cowardice and is roundly condemned by society. Perhaps you could have asked the Victim Support Unit of Zambia Police for information to help you produce a more balanced and factual article as opposed to the sensationalism to which journalism nowadays seems sadly inclined.

Bryan Mutakasha, Lusaka, Zambia ""I have stopped hitting my wife for the sake of our boys..."" Not because it is fundamentally wrong? And when your children aren't around, or have left home, that means it's acceptable to pick up where you left off? I don't see this as a redemption, unfortunately.

Claire, Brighton Wow, this story is very deep and i am glad it has been brought to our attention... My father often beat my mother when I was young especially when he was under the influence. When he was in those states I used to see the pure rage in his eyes as if had underlying issues with anger, maybe in his family, but my mother was also strong and would sometimes attack my father too. As a child I would jump in to stop my parents from hitting each other something which no child should ever see or hear let alone intervene. Now I am an adult in my own relationship and I have sometimes provoked my partner (who has never been violent) into being violent towards me because I guess something deep down inside of me says that that is something a man should do. Fortunately I am educated and I question why I did this, I sat down with my partner and we discussed this behaviour. It really worried me and reinforced how children learn through behaviour. My partner is extremely loving and we resolve our arguments with ought having to touch each other which in my belief is a sign of losing control of the situation! I am my partner's equal and he loves the fact that I am an independent WOMAN and not a child. But something else that worried me is when growing up I thought that all African men beat their wives. I remember asking my peers if their Dads hit their mums and I was shocked to know that not all African men hit their wives! You see what kind of impression children have? I'm pretty sure that the same practices happened when my father was growing up. I do feel that in some African cultures, including mine, that there is this ethic of discipline whether it is your wife or your child. Ultimately every relationship if different and domestic violence is a global thing with each country comes different attitudes. I really commend Ms Imboela coming out to talk about this

C, North West You guys out there, when a wife becomes big headed (abusive, nagging you, being very irresponsible, unfaithful) do you fold your hands and start singing for her!? on a serious note you have to lightly wake her up. Ask yourselves why in the western world there are many single moms and divorced, men do not take charge of the family affairs and as a result broken homes!

Frank, Kampala Your article seems to suggest that 'Wife Beating' is an African thing. Well it is not. It happens in the west as well. I am an African man living in the UK with his African wife; and of course we have our arguments, but even when we were in Africa, I never laid a hand on her. You know why? Cus my Dad never beat my mother, her Dad never beat her Mum, none of my friends or their parents ever do nor have they ever. So yes, it might be a problem in some parts but I doubt it's as rampant as your article suggests!

Ogbu, London UK l am from Zimbabwe, next door to Zambia. If you beat up a woman you are going to jail, l know its the same thing in Botswana too. So l don't see what's so African about that. lf you are so strong go beat up another man and lets see what happens.

Casey, texas, usa Both wife and husband have got a piece of their mind missing. I am a Zambian and I do not even recognise them as celebrities. Saboi's life style has been questionable with allegations that I wont go into. What these so-called celebrities need to realise is that being in the spotlight does not mean that you are free to misbehave. That's how and why they end up clobbered. And for Mwape, nowhere in the African or Zambian culture is it written that man shall beat woman. Just grow up.

Peter C. Njobvu, Lusaka, Zambia @Kaken Badjie, Serrekunda, the Gambia: Wife beating is wife beating, no matter what mealy-mouthed justification you try to use.

SF, Perth How about men who are beaten by their wives?

balyenge, Ndola, Zambia Its hard to come out like the two have done it and so it takes courage to do such. I too grew up in a home where i never saw dad beat my mum but I ended up marrying a woman who unfortunately thought could challenge me and to settle things, I ended up giving her a good beating and now she respects me though am not saying that's the better way of doing things. Hence at times its not for us men to think of beating our wives but we find in situations of wanting to settle things through beating our wives.

malama moyo, lusaka It is not a thing of a joy to see a woman being beaten up. I hate to beat a woman but to be frank with you i have done it several times with my wife simply because i could not stand her insult and in order to correct her of a lifestyle in which i think a married woman should not do for the sake of the growing children. I have made great effort to bring this lifestyle to a stop by bringing her mother, pastor and even other family members to settle the matter but to no avial. At the end of the day the marriage got spoilt and i took my children away because that was what i was fighting to correct. Will that be amounted to beating a woman when the woman is always fighting you with her hands more than a man can? In my family we don't hit a woman but i think my ex-wife has some evil spirit controlling her. Homes are broken in Ghana more than else where in Africa, what do we do to save homes and children?

Atta Adjai kofi, Ghana I would just like to add that a lot of the problem with wife-beating here in Zambia is due to alcohol abuse. It is not simply that men beat their wives. It is that they go out and get drunk and beat their wives. My housekeeper routinely comes to work with a fat lip or a swollen eye, because her husband takes money meant to feed the family and spends it on drink. If she complains he beats her. She can't leave home because her family are too poor to take in her and her three children. So she feels she has nowhere to go. That said, there is nothing particularly African about this. I'm American and my grandfather used to do the exact same thing to my grandmother. It is a global problem and one compounded by poverty and desperation. You have more of that here in Zambia, so you see it more often, but it exists everywhere.

Anne, Lusaka, Zambia well, wife battering is one barbaric thing which ought to have no place in this day and age. it is good to see celebrated couples come out in the open and reveal some of the past mistakes of their relationships. to a greater extent these prove to be a learning curve to a number of people about how not to act towards your partner. furthermore, i do not subscribe to the notion that this is a problem peculiar to the African man. it goes beyond that and any attempt to confine it to Africans is simply myopic and is devoid of sound reasoning. Ardent followers of the American entertainment are so very much alive to the scenario of Rihanna and Chris Brown which even led to the conviction of the latter. Women are our partners rightfully deserving every inch of respect. lets just love them more and be what we were meant to be to them. All the best to Saboi and Owas, i think they are a splendid couple.

Kambwa Aongola, Lusaka/Zambia It freezes me when I read such cliches as 'beating women is a part of our culture, or a way to show them love'. I am European, living in a partnership with 'an African' (with a somewhat 'painful past'). Learning each other's customs with regard to family life took time, and we had also a shaky period, which resulted in violence from both sides. I could report the incident to the police straightforward, but I decided to make use of the family bounds first - I notified my sister & mother-in-law, that we fight, and that my partner abuses his physical force. When the incident repeated after a few weeks, I contacted not the police, but a special local team of psychologists that deal with home violence without 'scaring' the violent man with direct legally determined punishment. (Aggressive people are often simply pushed to their limits and feel unsafe - this was the case here.) I can't say that our counselling resulted in complete peace straightforward, but it built up our confidence, so we don't have to rely on enforcing our points of view hectically and violently (as often both of us are right, but we would forget about it pushing the MINE-MINE point of view for the sake of winning the battle). If there's a way out of it - speak out loud to anyone you trust that it's painful, and you can't see any 'love' in being beaten up. Look for reasons, and, for goodness sake - learn to discuss things as equal entities. The police have to learn to give more psychological help, for both sides, instead of being a punishing force only. For us it has been more of an illness, and that's how we treated it. If the police can't help - the best help may come from other women who went through such a trauma and worked it out, similarly to 'alcoholic-anonymous' groups. This is what gives courage to stop the vicious circle, and the taboo. But - to be honest: I consulted a police officer to learn about my rights and duties (we've got such an option here in Holland: informing about a problem in contrast to reporting 'bad deeds'). Knowing that they will help me if I needed it, made me calm enough not to get into stupid, empty, useless arguments which I would take as attacks before.

Sarah, Netherlands Your article unfortunately seems to convey (through the commentators) that wife beating is an acceptable way of life in Africa. This is not only factually incorrect but may serve to create the impression for those seeking validation that it is an acceptable practice. You need only open the papers in any country in the world to know that its a phenomenon the world over. It is not as a practice confined to race, creed or culture. The bottom line is that violence, on any level, and whether its the husband beating the wife or the other way around, is not acceptable and should never be condoned.

Nancy, Jhb, South Africa It is amazing how people like to romanticize 'African culture'; assuming that there is such a thing in the first place. The reality is that the barbaric culture of abusing women is practiced in every corner of the world and all levels (rich or poor). This habit of sitting on a moral high ground and pointing fingers is in part a denial of the existence of the problem in one's society and underscores the complexity involved when trying to solve the problem.

Sebitosi Ben, Cape Town South Africa I think that beating your wife is something that you should never do under any circumstances. Unless she does something wrong, in which case I think it is justified because of tradition. But these traditions are wrong, so if she complains then stop.

Olu Obang, Birmingham, UK Have we forgotten that in England one woman a week is killed by her partner not to mention the hundreds of thousands that are assaulted daily or weekly. It is the stereotype of men as having to control women that is the cause and men feeling like they have to be in control, be strong and the only emotion they can show is anger that has brought us to this time where even in England its deemed justifiable to use violence against women in certain circumstances- as reported on the BBC last week.

Claire, Yorkshire, England I am Zambian married man, aged 42. The issue of wife beating is not as widespread as it has been put in this article. What I have seen for Africa is that all the bad things people are made to believe that they happen only in Africa .

Nyambe Nmshanawa, Mfuwe, Zambia Hi, I am living in vary poor country like Afghanistan that women have a lot of problem but, reading of this horrible news made me shocked. I hope women that side of the world come to sense fight with this decadency.

Lutfullah Sumeem, Herat Afghanistan Beating women is no good thou our African culture permits us (men) to discipline our wives by doing so, yet some women if are not beaten they complain of being not 'loved' by their husbands. We have to change the habit through education at primary schools.

Valentine Ndyambi, Morogoro, Tanzania I don't believe that domestic violence is restricted only to African countries like Zambia. In your analysis you seem to portray a perception that wife beating in Zambia is as result of some backward mentality and beliefs in both the Zambian women and men. YOU are very mistaken. Domestic violence is a world wide tragedy that many times leads to the killing of one of spouses of either gender. I have witnessed Zambian women that terrorise their husbands and what can you say about that?

Driad Sobongo, Lobatse, Botswana It has always been like that in Zambia where wife battering is an accepted form of punishment for any small thing the woman does. I remember growing up my father raised me to be independent and whenever I would speak out against any man, my aunts and friends used to shake their heads and say, ""You and your mouth, you are going to get a beating everyday from your husband"" or ""You will never be able to keep a man with that attitude"". I witnessed it in my uncles but never with my own father. It should stop but in my opinion, women and men are both too primitive to see how stupid this thinking is. As they say ""intambi nitambi"" - tradition is tradition.

Naomi S, Prague, Czech Republic It is true that wife beating is considered the 'proper way' for settling marital differences. What makes it worse is that a lot of men believe that women enjoy being hit and only respect a man who does so. I have heard many men say this, though only a few are willing to admit that they actually do it. I am yet to meet a woman who says she enjoys or expects to get hit by anyone she is in a relationship with, be it a husband or a boyfriend. There are women however, who stick it out because they believe all men hit anyway and also because they grew up in homes where their moms got hit by their dads. I grew up in a home where i never even got spanked by my parents who preferred to give a good scolding instead. And while my parents never had a smooth marriage, they never hit each other either. Perhaps as a direct result, i am as totally against this as possible and actually encouraged a friend to leave her abusive husband after 4 years of a hellish marriage. Not everybody supports me and sometimes i worry because she is having such a hard time coping by herself. But deep in my heart i know she made the right choice.

Devaan, Abuja, Nigeria You know, spousal abuse is not just an African traditional problem, it is a global one. Even in the developed world, there are many cases of spousal abuse that go unreported for the simple reason of ""economics"". As in the majority of households, the breadwinners are the men, that is, husbands, many women choose to remain silent in cases of spousal abuse for fear of loosing their main source of income or livelihood.

Gloria Chinebuah, Geneva, Switzerland beating women is not part of our live in africa, but at the same time beating is always meant to correct women especially those who are not faithful to their husbands. so not all form of beating are domestic violence. the amount of force applied during beating should be reasonable, moderate and proportional because women are humans like men.

Kaken Badjie, Serrekunda, the Gambia ""That's how you grow up in Africa,"" explains Mr Mwape. ""To be a man, you need to discipline a woman, give her a slap or two. You know, in our culture, it's OK because that's how we feel we love our women."" Sorry Mr Mwape, that is not how we grow up in Africa. That is how uncivilised men and educated illiterates treat their spouses. My parents were married for about 50 years in Ghana before they died, both in their 70s. My dad did not believe in hitting a woman.

Isaac, Toronto, Canada Among the Ibos in East Nigeria, when a man beats a woman married or not the extended family brothers will revenge by beating back the man. It is the responsibility of the brothers to protect their sisters. Alternatively, the woman drops the children for the man and go back to her parents for a while. Men are more dependent than women in marriage. I advice the women when beaten by their men to simply drop the children for them and go on a holidays for a while.

Sunny Ekwenugo, Berlin, Germany As a Luo man i do not agree with people saying that wife beating is african way of life. this is what people are implicating. from my community long time ago if a husband beats his wife and she goes to her people the the husband and his relatives will go to her home. then if it is found that the husband was wrong then he will get it rough from wife side and if wife was wrong she will disciplined by her people but not beating. then she will go back her husband and life will continue. wife beating was a crime in my community even before education, christianity and islam came to Luoland.

romanus onyango, KISUMU, KENYA Violence has no place in marriage and indeed it takes a lot to come out publicly and admit what happened to these 2 lovely people. Zambian / African culture encourages beating as a form of punishment and our police will always try and talk women from taking further action. This is wrong and should come to a stop. The bravery exhibited by this amazing couple should be emulated by all Zambians.

Aaron Sakala, Lusaka Zambia The issue of domestic violence against women in Africa is totally caused by our culture and our acceptance that women are subordinates in the home, as a result men, even ones without jobs or any source of income still bask in the euphoria of being the superior one and can show superiority by hitting or raping the woman. As a woman of African origin, I once dated a Nigerian man who hit me. When I told him I was leaving him as a result, he begged and told me that was his way of showing me love. How sick! I accepted and went on with the relationship until an ambulance came to pick me up from his house one day. That was the turning point for me. Do I have any regrets? Yes...that I stayed with that man for that long, what if I had died! This a call to all women, get out now.

kemi, london, uk While Africa is a patriarchal continent it is very misleading to say as in the article that wife beating is acceptable and part of African custom. I am West African from the Yoruba speaking part of Nigerian and in my particular culture Wife beating is frowned upon and considered taboo, a man that assaults his wife is not respected and seen as less of a man by both families. You will find that practices in Africa differ significantly depending on the part of the continent you are in.

2000: 'The sky was ablaze',,[],2000-01-01 00:00:00,"2000: 'The sky was ablaze'

It was the biggest party the world had ever seen - around the globe star-studded gigs and spectacular fireworks entertained billions of people seeing in the New Millennium.

In Washington, President Clinton was a guest at an outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial.

In Egypt, floodlights lit up the ancient pyramids of Giza as French composer Jean-Michel Jarre performed his epic Twelve Dreams of the Sun electronic opera.

In London two million people lined the River Thames to watch a spectacular fireworks display. The Queen, Prime Minister Tony Blair and other VIPs went to a special concert at the newly opened Millennium Dome in Greenwich.

Your memories

I was 13 at the time. My parents and I went to London to see the monster celebrations there.

We stood on Waterloo Bridge from five in the afternoon to make sure we had a good view of the show. My feet were killing me, but it was worth it!

The fireworks were awesome! It was an experience I will never forget as long as I live.

Alex Prior, UK

I can never forget seeing just so many fireworks being let off at the same time! The sky was ablaze!

It now seems such a shame that all that excitement and great expectation of the New Millennium has sadly not lived up to what we all were hoping it would be?

Chris, UK

I saw the New Millennium in on the beach in Mexico with loads of other revellers.

That morning on the beach I defied all advice for taking photos and as the sun rose of that New Millenium I took some of the most amazing pictures of a sunrise ever.

James, UK

I was living in the village of Bontnewydd (some four degrees west of Greenwich) and noted that we would enter the Millennium 16 minutes after Greenwich.

Sure enough at 12.16am GMT my grandparents and myself could see fireworks launching from the nearby hills and a few moments later from Tregardon (celebrating 20 minutes after Greenwich).

Harry Hayfield, Wales

I was 12 years old as the bells tolled on the millennium.

It was an odd feeling as there was so much expectation and hype about the Millennium that no-one knew if we were going to disappear, if the clocks would stop, the TV would turn off.

And so when it was all ok and everything went unchanged I realised I was 12 and another year older. But to have my birthday on such a special day in history is something I will never forget.

The Millennium was a crazy time with so much going on and so much happening that everyone was in a frenzy. What a day!

Douglas Reid, Scotland

I was in Sydney at the time and wouldn't have been anywhere else! The hundreds of boats on the harbour and the incredible fireworks off Sydney Harbour Bridge made it a night to remember always!

Matt Swanton, Reading

Don't presume this'll be published, but just thought you might like a different perspective:

The Millennium itself was a study in hype which saw various people reverting to type, and though everyones' expectations were ripe, it was just another day.

We were warned of the bug by a number of [geeks], it'd make systems crash and pull all sorts of tricks, but I mashed with the lads and stayed up 'til gone six. (It was just another day.)

All over the world folks were having a ball from Sydney to Rome to the old Berlin Wall. But the cash that was wasted just makes my skin crawl. It was just another day.

And so at the next time of goodwill to men (no matter what might be going down then) we'll go through the whole damn palaver again, though it's just another day.

Martin Jones, Germany

I just thought it was one big day really but it was a good year for me personally as I celebrated my 40th birthday in May 2000.

Amanda Cerasale

I stood with my close family and friends on London Bridge for five hours in the freezing cold but had the best time.

We were all with the people we cared about and had such a laugh, there was the unusual camaraderie betweens Londoners and tourists (we were the lucky Londoners at that time!).

It was a great night, one I'll always remember!

Lynn Mollan, Scotland

Like a great many fathers, I was divorced with only occasional access to my kids. I had not had them over Christmas, but had them for New Year's Eve (so my ex-wife could celebrate freely!)

We had a 'special tea' and played games and watched TV during the evening, with champagne cooling in the fridge.

At midnight we went out into the garden alerted by the bangs to several firework displays in the area. Nothing special by some peoples' standards, but common enough for divorced fathers paying painful CSA costs, yet having rare or no access to their kids.

It WAS a special night for us, and they used a glass painting kit to decorate a plain whisky glass. That is now a treasured possession, and brought out to mark special events!

Graham Coad, Cornwall

My wife and I, my son and his girlfriend, were guests of the Department of Culture Media and Sport. (I was the official representative of the Baha'i community.)

We started the evening at a reception in the House of Lords, at which various people were given Millennium Awards. I managed to shake hands with Tony Blair

We were then conducted to Westminster Underground station and shepherded onto special Jubilee Line trains to take us to the Dome.

When we got to North Greenwich we avoided the queues to get into the Dome and found our way to our special seats, having collected our tray of food and our drinks.

We all stood and faced the Queen as we sang the National Anthem. The show to open the Dome was spectacular, other than the fireworks that went off inside the Dome at midnight. I think those outside on the banks of the Thames did better for fireworks.

We all (even the Queen) joined hands to sing 'Auld Lang Syne' at midnight as we entered the new Millennium. All very exciting, even if it was really an arbitrary moment in the calendar.

Rather more significant in the long term, was a special multi-faith event hosted in the House of Lords on 3 January. This was the first time that the government publicly acknowledged the existence of nine major faith communities in the UK.

Chris Smith, then Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport, read out the names of each of the faith communities, including my own (the Baha'i community) and each community made kind of artistic presentation in the presence of a member of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Barney Leith, UK

I spent it with my children sitting at the end of the bed of my wife, who had ealier had a heart attack, toasting the emergency staff with a glass of non alcoholic wine.

Anonymous

We were running late as usual, so by the time we set out for Westminster it was approximately 9 o'clock.

We were stuck in tube tunnels for a good hour and a half, people were getting on edge and a bit ratty.

As soon as we arrived in Westminster,we found a good spot near Winston Churchill statue, midnight was something else.

The crowd was so ablaze with energy, the sky lit up over Big Ben with every colour ever seen, for a good while too. I will never forget the millenium night ever.

Steve Quinn, England

Here in Fort William, which is the second largest town in the north-west highlands of Scotland next to the then town (now City) of Inverness, I went down to join in the fun in our town's High Street from 2200hrs - 2345hrs, this was due to the fact, that I wanted to be with my late mother, as she was in her late 80's.

The town held a Scottish country dance party from one end to the outher end of the High Street.

There was also a band playing in front of the local TIC, which is also in the middle of the street the crowds were eight deep on each side of the street and that did not include those who were actully dancing.

On the night, it had been both windy and rainy early on but by 2200 hours, it had both stopped raining and the wind had also gone away.

At the east end of the town, there was a ''laser light display'' plus a wonderful fireworks display, as well.

I should say that as there was no trouble. The local police, both PC's and WPC's, had a great time. They joined in the fun as they went about there duties through the crowds.

The only way to describe it was that it was fantastic fun filled night, and one that I will never forget. I'm 57 years old and disabled but I would not have missed it for anything.

Nicholas, Scotland

I was in a small village in Lincolnshire and was only able to see the fireworks after the millenium because as men, me and my uncle went outside and then came back in the new year with wood, coal and salt. It was worth it though because from the street fireworks were going off all over!

Andi, UK On millenium night my wife and a small party of us went to see the new Millenium in London. We waited to see the fireworks display close to the Festival Hall. We never saw the so called ""river of fire"" but to be fair the fireworks display was magnificent.

The whole thing was spoilt for me by the completely useless organisation. We could not find any toilets and the ladies in our party were forced to relieve themselves under some steps at the Festival Hall.

The food places were out of food by about 2300, but worse was to come when we tried to get home. A huge mob of us tried to converge on Waterloo station which was shut by the time we got there because of the crush.

At this point we weren't going anywhere, stuck in a pedestrian tunnel close to the Imax cinema at Waterloo. At last we extricated ourselves after about an hour, and we continued to walk to Vauxhall through a mass of broken bottles and glass only to find this station closed also.

Outside the station there was a vast number of people milling around waiting for occasional buses. Eventually we spotted a night-bus approaching from Clapham junction. We rushed across the road and managed to get on.

Within 5 minutes the bus was full but the driver said he was not supposed to depart until 0300. After some negotiation the bus departed a little earlier. We arrived at Clapham Junction to find the majority of trains from Waterloo were already full and not stopping at Clapham.

However around 0500 we caught a train to Woking and then changed and waited another half-hour for a train to Brookwood. Eventually we arrived home near Chobham at 0630 on 1 January.

To my mind the lack of organisation as far as numbers of people and transportation were concerned was a complete farce and the resultant crushes on the way home were positively frightening and dangerous. I later marvelled that nobody had been killed.

Even if I lived for a 1000 years I wouldn't go to the next one. In my opinion the whole organisation of this event was unfortunately left to inept inexperienced politicians, and it showed. The organisation should have been entrusted to more experienced people such as the team that organised Diana's funeral or the celebration of the Queen Mother's centenary. I rest my case!

David Snell, Great Britain

I was 30 years old when the figures for the year turned from 999 to 000. I couldn't believe the millions of people who thought they were celebrating the 'new millennium'!

I had a quiet night, but I had a good time celebrating the new millennium a year later.
