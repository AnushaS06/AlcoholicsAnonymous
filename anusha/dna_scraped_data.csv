'Satyamev Jayate' gets AA drunk on its own success,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2012-07-02T09:15:00,"The General Service Office (GSO) of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) India, which operates from a tiny municipal school in Byculla, was bursting at its seams as nearly 100 AA members and volunteers attended to a torrent of calls after a national TV show flashed AA’s helpline numbers and website details, on Sunday. In its ninth episode which first aired at 11am, Satyamev Jayate focused on alcoholism and featured interviews with experts and recovering alcoholics, including AA member Laxman. As the show’s producer and host Aamir Khan announced the number on air, AA offices across the country braced themselves.Gajanan, Rotated trustee of AA India who was at the AA office in Mumbai, said, “The number was first flashed on the show at 11.37am and at 11.40am we received the first call. Within 20 minutes, the AA website had crashed. At 12.30am, all telephone lines were jammed and missed calls started piling up. Within the next hour, we received 8,600 missed calls.” By 4pm, AA centers across India had received 13,000 calls which jumped up to 28,000 by 7 in the evening after the show aired. At the time of going to print, More than 31,000 calls were recorded. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of recovering alcoholics who follow the universally accepted 12 Step program for recovery from addiction. Mr. Gnyaneshwar, general manager, AA India, said, “After a lot of groundwork, the show’s research team came to the conclusion that AA programme is a reliable recovery source for alcoholism that is available pan-India and completely free of cost.”In India, there are at present more than 1,100 groups with approximately 30,000 members. But members feel this is just a small proportion of the actual number of alcoholics who are suffering from a lack of awareness about a recovery programme that actually works. Agreeing that the show is the biggest boost that the Alcoholics Anonymous India fellowship has ever received, the members say the biggest difference will be felt in parts of the country where AA self-help groups are yet to be set up. Gajanan said, “Many areas such as Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Bihar and large parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh do not have AA groups. Once we receive calls from a place where a self-help group is missing, we will send a team of AA members who will help the locals set up a self-help group to conduct regular meetings and help alcoholics practice the recovery programme.” One of the most lasting effects of the show is in the form of the donations that are generated via viewers who wish to contribute to the cause. But AA India politely declined the monetary help because the fellowship, in principle, does not accept donations from outside sources. All AA activities are funded by members of the fellowship only, said, chairman, public information, AA India.He added, “We will pool in our own resources to reach out to alcoholics across the country. We are expecting to spend a lot of money in the next six months to reach out to alcoholics.” Alcoholics Anonymous is rumored to have members from all strata of society, including the rich and powerful. Here again, due to the principle of anonymity, members’ full names & identities are never declared. Eventually, members feel the biggest contribution of the show will be in creating awareness that alcoholism is not just a ‘bad habit’, it is a full-fledged disease which has a reliable cure. Elated over the tremendous response, AA members in the city are gearing up for a busy week. Similar AA call centers have been set up in Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Guwahati, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Calicut, Delhi, Bangalore and Nagpur, among other cities. The show will be aired 14 times in the coming week in eight different languages, and the calls are expected to keep pouring in. AA members are ready to cooperate with government agencies to keep the momentum going even after the show stops airing. Clarion calls To streamline the process, a 15-member team of volunteers took down basic details from callers, who included alcoholics themselves or family members and well-wishers Their numbers were then passed on to nearly 100 AA members who sat in the corridors of the municipal school in Byculla from which the AA office operates The members answered all queries and connected the caller to AA members in their vicinity who in turn will ensure that the alcoholic attends a local AA meeting within the next 48 hours to begin his recovery. As per the latest news, people have started attending AA meetings in various groups all over India.AA assures Anonymity to all people having a Desire to stop drinking.If you know of someone who has a drinking problem & needs help guide him to AA the contact details are as follows:-SMS – AAAA (SPACE) YOUR NAME TO 56363CALL- 09022771011E-MAIL – gsoindia@gmail.comWeb- www.aagsoindia.orgFor a serialised version of AA's Big Book, pick up your copy of DNA every Tuesday.",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-satyamev-jayate-gets-aa-drunk-on-its-own-success-1709259
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting- The battle with the bottle,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2011-09-18T12:00:00,"Smoking seems to have replaced drinking. This is the impression I get when I reach the venue of an AA meeting at 6.30 on a Saturday evening. Four men are gathered around the parking lot, cracking the odd joke, pulling each other’s leg about the nagging wife, waiting for their buddies to arrive so they can begin the meeting. By the time others show up and they stub out their third, maybe fourth cigarette, it’s 6.45 — time to move to the library room in the Arya Samaj Mandir where the meeting is to be held.We’re all sitting on school benches. This is also a make-shift classroom, for the children of the underprivileged. The walls have cobwebs. The switchboard is uncovered. Dusty wires hang unattended. A yellowed chart drawn by a child has pictures of four kinds of fans.Despite the puzzled faces wondering what I’m doing there if I’m not a drinker, I’m welcomed warmly. One of the men who I’ve only just met, Manish, 48, covers for me: “She’s here to observe.”We are a total of eight men and three women — two of whom, including me, are observers. The third, Claire, is a striped-pajamas-wearing American in her fifties. She sits down with one of those thermos-mug things in her lap. The other woman, Priyanjali, in a creased, red and white salwar-kameez, is the wife of a ‘first-timer.’The meeting begins with the group members introducing themselves: “Hi, I’m Rajiv and I’m an alcoholic.” A loud, enthusiastic chorus greets him, “Hi Rajiv!” or a “Hi, my name is Peeyusha and I’m an alcoholic.” Again, loud chorus: “Hi Peeyusha!”Alcoholics Anonymous is a publicity-shy group. Point eleven of their twelve traditions says: “Our PR policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need to maintain anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.” Naturally then, they aren’t keen on having undercover reporters in their midst, going, “Hi my name is such-and-such, and I’m an observer” — which is what I did. To my surprise, none of them had a problem with my presence. I even made a few friends.Like Manish, for instance. The chain-smoking, jovial hotelier is unafraid to take, and dish out, a few good-natured punches. September 4 was his ‘anniversary’ — he’s been sober for five years. Not a drop since the day at the bank when he couldn’t tally his signature and the lady at the counter had to make him sign 17 times. He still couldn’t tally it. His hands shook so much. Finally, he had to excuse himself, go to the car, and ask his driver to pour him a stiff one.Sitting in the backseat, he knocked back that large whiskey in the middle of the day, steadied his hand, and produced a clear, perfect match of a signature. This was Manish’s moment of humiliation. He shares this in the meeting, not proud, but unafraid to bare his demons. Some look down. Some close their eyes. But there is no room for judgments.As Claire says when asked why AA meetings work: “You leave the bullshit at the door.” Fellow AA-members welcome that. Every meeting has a moderator, a leader, a pied piper, a class teacher, as it were. In this one, it’s Manish. Halfway through the meeting, two volunteer to get everyone coffee. The cups are handed out quietly.Incomplete sentences hang in the air — “I was going downhill so fast, my mother gave up on me…”; “I hold the record among my friends for maximum car crashes…”; “My wife went to live with my sister… she couldn’t take it that I would get drunk and bruise myself banging into tables, falling all over and next morning not remembering how I got these blue marks...”; “I love alcohol more than my family”; “I was angry I wasn’t allowed to go to parties anymore…”.Saying things out loud helps. That is the premise: talk it out, we’ll help you, we’re all in this together. At AA, you follow the 12 steps (see box) and learn to rely more on people (your sponsors) than on the bottle. When you feel like you might cave in, be it at 5am, the onus is on you to dial an AA pal for a pep talk, a little moral support, some hand holding. Abstinence is the only cure to what some call a disease. The struggle, more than to put the bottle/glass down, is to remain sober every day.The first timer, dragged to the meeting by his wife Priyanjali, is from a royal family, and in the last 10 years, hasn’t been sober for more than 8 hours. Royalty (my unimaginative nickname for him) doesn’t speak. His wife smiles at me. Her husband’s come in sloshed, his features ravaged by drink.Royalty sits with his eyes closed. His liver is on crutches and he’s reeking of the stuff. When the person next to him says, “I eat mithai when I want to drink”, he giggles helplessly. He’s half a peg away from being carted off to rehab. But his wife, in her crushed white salwar and pained smiles, insists he try AA first. She wants him to talk about his problem. He doesn’t want to talk. He just wants a refill.At the close of the meeting, a little cloth purse is passed around discreetly — donations. People gathered slip in as much as they like in the pool. One wallet dispenses with a hundred, some fumble for change. How much of yourself you give to AA is totally up to you.*Names have been changed on request To find an AA meeting closest to you, log on to aagsoindia.org/location.htm",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-alcoholics-anonymous-meeting-the-battle-with-the-bottle-1588417
"Alcohol Anonymous, 47 years old today, proves a boon to Bangalore",[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2011-06-26T12:40:01,"The story of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is that of exemplary courage. Individual accounts of fighting a Goliath, armed with nothing but a desire to win. Even after years of abstaining from alcohol, there’s no bravado. After all, the AA fellows take one day at a time, always.AA has come a long way from its humble start in 1935 at Akron, Ohio. Bill W, a New York stockbroker, and Dr Bob S, a surgeon — both alcoholics who had several futile attempts at fighting alcoholism — met, shared stories, and the first stone was laid at what was to become AA later. Here too, AA started small. A handful of friends got together, spoke about their “alcohol problem” and thus was born the Bangalore chapter of AA in 1964. Sunday, June 26, is the 47th anniversary of the kinship.True to its name, personal anonymity is strict tradition AA members maintain while speaking in public. Each of them has gone through an extraordinary journey, and do not hesitate to share it if that could help a stumbling alcoholic find way back into life. “If my story can give one person the courage to find help to fight alcoholism, then I’ll be grateful,” that’s all he said before taking hours off his busy Saturday to talk to DNA. For now, let’s call him Mr X.Mr X was an exceptionally gifted child born to a happy, wealthy, and by all means, established family in Bangalore. Sports, dramatics, debating society… he excelled in all. He was 12 years old when at a Christmas party he decided to imitate the family elders doing a bottoms-up on a Chianti bottle. “The buzz hit me. I remember dancing a bit and crashed in my bed.”Next morning, he got an ear-full from his parents. His next taste of alcohol came during his first year of under-grad. His team had won a prestigious football match. His friends wanted to celebrate, and got a bottle of arrack. Some of them had their girlfriends with them, and one of the girls taunted him: “You are the captain of the winning team, and can’t you hold a drink?” Rankled, he downed his first peg. After his graduation, he moved to the US for further studies. He couldn’t afford his drinks with the pocket money, and so decided to work – as a bartender. He even got himself certified in six months time. Somewhere along, he noticed his behavioural changes. At the first drink he was happy, and two drinks later, he was irritated.Soon he began suffering from alcohol induced schizophrenia. Then he got into the next stage of alcoholism — paranoia, fear, blackouts. “Alcoholism is the only disease that says you don’t have a problem even when you are dying because of it,” he says, recalling his stubborn denial of his condition.“Anything and everything became a reason to drink. I didn’t realise that all alcoholics find concocted reasons to drink.” Living with an altered sense of reality became his norm. Hallucinations, delirium tremors – it got out of hand, and something told him that a geographical relocation would be his panacea. He gave away all the material possessions he acquired over the years, and came back to Bangalore. He was just 27. His family took him in gladly, and for a short while, he reined himself, took over family business, but soon was back to drinking one to two bottles everyday. His family decided that marriage would “settle” his ways, but he was against it. “But my parents introduced me to this beautiful girl, and I fell in love. I confessed my wild ways to her, but she was naïve enough to see it all in a romantic light. We got married.” Little did she realise that alcoholism is a “family disease” that affects everyone around the alcoholic. She suffered with him as his drinking got worse. The trauma went on for another three years. His guilt on how he was ruining the lives of his loved ones drove him to drink even more, and he attempted suicide thrice. After his third botched try, a friend gave him three choices. First: write a will, and absolve family from all liabilities, move somewhere away, drink and die. Second: Go to a detox centre, live for four months and then come back. Third: attend an AA meeting that evening.The third choice sounded most doable. “I had heard about AA long before, but had always dismissed it as something for those who couldn’t control themselves.” He was in for a surprise. They were all just like him — all desired to stop drinking, but couldn’t. There, he met an old friend, whom he thought had died four years ago. “He told me: ‘You have come to the right place’. He was off alcohol for three years by then, and suddenly I was around people who understood exactly what I was going through. That meant so much. It was a miracle. There was no fee involved, no advice, all I had to do was to attend the meeting everyday, and stay off alcohol for that day.”It’s been 18 years and six months since that evening meeting. He hasn’t taken a sip of alcohol since. “I am alive because of this fellowship,” he says, happily. Mr X is the charming Bangalorean almost everyone in the city knows.He works, sings, dances, throws parties, and has the best time at them, but without alcohol. He still attends AA meets regularly and is available 24/7 for any alcoholic who reaches out to AA for help.",https://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-alcohol-anonymous-47-years-old-today-proves-a-boon-to-bangalore-1559232

Alcoholic women seeking support on the rise,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2012-08-09T12:36:20,"Eight years since its formation in Pune, ‘Women in sobriety’ – the women’s fellowship group of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) – has seen a rise in the number of women seeking help with their alcohol addiction. However, as coordinator of the group Gita (name changed on request) says the challenge for them is to reach out to women in smaller towns, who are struggling with being alcoholics.“Easy availability of alcohol is a major cause for the rise in the number of alcoholics. However, unlike Pune, cities such as Nagpur, Indore, Satara and others do not have proper fellowships projects for people recovering from alcoholism,” she said. Such people are referred to centres in cities like New Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune and Mumbai, where women’s groups are functional.Another important issue that has lead to an increase in incidents of alcoholism is peer pressure and the change in social fabric, where those not consuming alcohol are looked upon as social misfits.The group works on the principle of AA, where alcoholics are encouraged to tackle their addiction with therapy and sharing. Working on the 12-point principle of AA, the group meets every Sunday, where members who have been sober for long share their experience with new members and give them moral strength to fight their addiction.Women alcoholics, Gita said have their unique set of problems, which requires special and attention. “However, in most cases, the families try to deny that the women are drinking and delay seeking professional help. This aggravates the addiction more,” she said.The group in Pune, which meets every Sunday, has members ranging between the age group of 18-50 years. “Women alcoholics require the company of other women as many feel uncomfortable in AA meetings, which are dominated by men,” she said.",https://www.dnaindia.com/pune/report-alcoholic-women-seeking-support-on-the-rise-1725806
Number of Indian teenagers consuming alcohol increases: Is the future sloshed?,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2017/01/12/537671-booze.jpg,2017-01-12T00:00:00,"The taboo around alcohol has come down significantly in India, especially in metro cities, where it has been accepted as a way of socialising, not only among adults but also among teenagers.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 30 per cent of India’s population consumes alcohol regularly. The percentage of under-15 boys who have not had alcohol has gone down from 44 per cent to 30 per cent and for girls it has decreased from 50 per cent to 31 per cent, reveals another study done by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Easy availability of liquor, access to alcohol at home, curiosity, peer pressure and its association with a certain kind of lifestyle have contributed to this shift in drinking patterns. According to Dr Rajesh Kumar, who has been running SPYM, a de-addiction centre in Delhi, more teenagers are now consuming alcohol and reasons are still the same — peer-pressure and the need to fit in a group. ‘Try at least once’ is how it starts for many teenagers, he says. Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa believes that alcohol is often taken as a status symbol. He says, “For boys, it’s about their ability to withstand the amount of liquor.”Liquor inside the schoolIn a conversation with school students, many admit buying liquor themselves from a store or arranging it from their parents’ collection.“My friend brought vodka in a water bottle. We tried it during the lunch break. Nobody got a whiff of it,” says Shruti*, a Class 12 student in Indore. She considers it a thrilling experience without having to face any consequences. Her friend had arranged the booze from her father’s bar.In another incident in Delhi, Kunal*, a student of Class 9 mixed vodka in water and brought it to the school. Not only was he drinking it inside the classroom but was also sharing it with his friends. However, he was caught on his way home in the school bus and his parents were called. His mother blatantly refused to believe that her child would indulge in drinking.While liquor consumption by teenagers was earlier limited to parties, weekend trips, and sleepovers, now taking alcohol to school has become a new trend and these two aren’t the only examples. “Socially, everything has changed, more so in India where the availability of drinks is in excess without any monitoring. Bacardi’s Breezer has around 4% of alcohol in it, but you need not go to a liquor shop to buy it as it is easily available in regular shops,” says Springdales School’s Principal Ameeta Wattal.Questioning modern day parenting, she says, “In India, parents have become liberal. They allow children to drink Breezer or wine occasionally. These children are then likely to go ahead and try whiskey and other hard drinks. Parents do not know how to say no these days. All they want to do is be their child’s friend. If everybody is going to be a friend, who is going to be a parent? Parenting is important too! It is required very much in Indian metro cities.”While schools have put the onus on parenting, parents find themselves in a complicated situation where they think being a friend is better than staying as a stranger. “Children are going to do what they want to, either we be in sync with it and tell them what should be done to what extent or remain oblivious to their life. I am concerned about where and how much is my daughter drinking and that is due to health and safety reasons. I am not against it morally,” says a mother of a 13-year-old girl.“Consumption of alcohol among children is rampant. When high school children party, alcoholic beverages are a part of it. These days it has entered school premises as well. On outstation trips, children are smuggling alcohol in shampoo bottles. They drink and that’s how it is. My daughter is 16 and I am aware she takes a drink or two socially,” adds another mother on condition of anonymity.Binge drinkingAnother reason for the rising issue is the various games based on liquor or centred around it, which are now gaining popularity amongst teenagers. Binge drinking, bottoms-up, or doing shots determine who can drink the most and with minimum intervals, thus leading to more alcohol consumption. According to a survey by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), young people across the globe consume more than 90 per cent of their alcohol through binge drinking. Statistics also reveal that at least once in a month, 5.3 million young people had 5 or more drinks on the same occasion, within a few hours. And, 1.3 million young people had 5 or more drinks on the same occasion on 5 or more days over a month.Director of Don Bosco Youth Services (DBYS), Fr Cleophas Braganza blames consumerism for this change. According to him, “The urban youth are more exposed to the culture of consumerism which seeks to promote a lifestyle of hedonism and many literally live for the weekend where they can splurge lavishly without any care.”Laws in IndiaThere is no uniform law related to legal age of drinking in India as it varies from state to state since the subject of alcohol is included in the State list. While it is legal to drink alcohol at the age of 18 in Puducherry and Rajasthan, it is 25 in Delhi. In fact, the age at which one can legally buy liquor is different from the age at which it can be consumed.For example, in Maharashtra, one can buy a bottle of whiskey at the age of 18 but can consume it only if the person is above 25.Drinking and driving is a punishable offence with a jail term or fine or both, but the laws are applicable only for adults since under-18 offenders come under juvenile category and thus can’t be taken for a medical examination or to the police station. It is also the reason why most teenagers get away easily.On January 1, 2017, a 17-year-old was caught drunk after his car hit a 40-year-old woman in South-west Delhi’s Nasirpur area. Even as his mother refused to accept that her son could drink alcohol, the witness confirmed that the boy was smelling of liquor and seemed tipsy. There are several such incidents but barely a few get reported due to the age factor. This particular incident caught everyone’s eye as the boy failed to escape the place where the incident happened and also because the woman was badly injured. Usually, young students get away by paying a small amount to the traffic police.While some question laws, Advocate Amit Karkhanis suggests that considering the changing social structure, there should be some provision where juveniles are not seen as children but are treated according to the gravity of an offence. “We can’t find every solution in law. Some changes need to be embedded at home through parenting.”Why drinking has an age limitIt is scientifically proven that the sooner a child starts drinking, the higher are chances of him/her developing dependency on it. That’s why the drinking age is kept between 21-25 years. Another reason is that the brain of a person develops till the age of 18-20. Underage drinking can therefore affect the development process and is therefore discouraged, says Dr Kumar.Alcohol is a brain depressant and gets absorbed quickly into the bloodstream from the stomach and the small intestine. If consumed over a prolonged span of time, it may cause damage to major organs, including the liver and/or the brain. It also contains ethanol or ethyl alcohol, an intoxicating agent which produces mind-altering effects and even a small quantity of it can impair the judgment required to take decisions including operation of an automobile. Thus, drinking and driving lead to road accidents as it has happened in the past.What’s happening around the worldAccording to the NIAAA, about 35 per cent of teens across the globe have had at least 1 drink by the age of 15, whereas, about 65 per cent of teens have had at least 1 drink by the age of 18. 61 per cent of the 190 countries have a drinking age of 18 or 19 years old. It is 21 years for the United States and 11 other countries, and between 18-25 in India. However, according to Procon.org, it is banned in all 16 Muslim countries, while some have concessions for non-Muslims.How to solve the problemWorking with the purpose to ensure alcoholics stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety, a self-help group named Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has over 10,000 members in Mumbai, highlighting the number of people with the realisation of an addiction. However, youngsters aren’t keen on bringing any change.“Teens have started coming for these meetings but they are not too determined to quit drinking alcohol. They have to understand that they have to play the role of a doctor for themselves,” says Ashok Ghadge, who was an alcoholic 14 years ago and is now a counselor in AA. Education is the only solution. We need to make students aware about alcohol and it effects on their body as a part of their curriculum. They need to be explained why underage drinking is discouraged. Also, parents need to encourage a discussion around it instead of scolding their children after they get caught, says Dr Kumar. He further adds that banning is not a solution, be it at home or in the state. We should rather encourage responsible drinking.(*names have been changed)",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-is-the-future-sloshed-2291610
A dubious high for ‘spirited’ women in India’s cities,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2010-05-26T01:51:00,"This is one glass ceiling one wishes women hadn’t broken. In what could be a sign of changing lifestyles, more and more women are seeking help for problems related to alcohol consumption.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) India, which completes 53 years in the country this May, has seen a sharp increase in the number of women — most of them in their twenties — attending its meetings. In fact, AA’s Mumbai chapter has even started organising weekly meetings exclusively for women alcoholics.“Apart from Mumbai, such women-only AA meetings are also being held in Delhi, Pune, Bangalore and Chandigarh, which is another indicator of the fact that more and more women are seeking help,” said SK Bhalla, chairman, AA India.Worldwide, a third of the total membership in AA is female. In India, it is much lower, Bhalla said.There are about 12 women — most of them in their twenties — who attend the exclusive women’s meetings in Mumbai. “When I came to AA at the age of 25, I felt out of place as there was not a single woman in the meeting,” recalled Suzan Gomes (name changed), who completed 19 years of sobriety on May 15.Having failed in her previous attempts to start a women’s group owing to the fact that not many women were willing to come forward, Gomes, the 45-year-old resident of a western suburb, finally succeeded in starting the women’s group a year ago with the help of like-minded women.“We meet once a week on Wednesdays between 8 and 9pm. And we have seen a number of people attending it and we plan to increase the timing of the meetings,” she said.Indian women, according to Gomes, have a bigger problem. A survey showed that the maximum number of female alcoholics was in Goa followed by Mumbai.“Women drink straight out of the bottle, and as a result consume a lot more,"" she said. ""They had access to a lot of hiding places in the house — be it in their wardrobe, kitchen cabinet, or toilet flush.”Psychiatrists agree that alcohol addiction among women is on the rise. “Over the years consuming alcohol has become socially acceptable for women. This has encouraged a lot of women to take up drinking,” said psychiatrist Dr Shrikant Pandit, adding that binge drinking is on the rise among women.“[But] there has been a change in attitude towards seeking help, with several families calling up for enquiries.

Pooja Bhatt REVEALS what made her BANISH alcohol from her life,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2017/03/02/552981-429844-pooja-bhatt.jpg,2017-03-02T00:00:00,"It's been 67 days since Pooja Bhatt, decided to go sober and banish alcohol from her life starting from December 24. She sailed through Christmas, New Year and her 45th birthday celebrations on February 24, shunning alcohol.Pooja doesn't shy away from talking about her personal struggles in the open. Speaking of her catharsis to Mumbai Mirror, she said, ""I want to bust the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it's a matter of shame for the family. We don't share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer.""Pooja confesses that in her case, it was a chat with her father that led to this decision. On December 21, Mahesh Bhatt messaged her and discussed the political scenario in the country, as the conversation came to an end, he signed off saying, ""I love you kid."" She responded, ""I love you too pops. As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing else worth loving in the world,"" to which he replied, ""If you love me then love yourself because I live in you,"" added the report.Bhatt Sr had never pointed out to her problem, but the text urging her to love herself, prompted her to turn things around. Pooja promised him that ""from this moment I'm going to be the best 'me' I'm capable of being,"" and after the conversation ended, thought if going out with someone and indulging in a bottle of whisky was loving herself. A vehement 'no' was the answer.Reportedly, Pooja, who is Christian by faith, put her phone on silent and stayed put in her apartment on Christmas day. ""I ate dinner and went to bed at 11.40 pm, sober. At midnight I heard the bells of the four churches ring and felt rejuvenated,"" she reminisces.Later, she went on a vacation to Lahore, Delhi and other places. Unlike in her past, when she would spend the evenings by herself, with a bottle of wine for company, in some café, this time she stayed away from alcohol. She resisted the lure even through New Year celebrations.She felt peer pressure to have a drink as her birthday came closer, toying with the idea of taking one drink. ""But then I asked myself if I needed it, and if I did, why stop with one glass? Why not drink the whole bottle of champagne because as somebody said, 'One drink is had with the enemy.' I called my friends to my farm, we swam at 2 am, we did many fun things, but I didn't drink,"" she recalled.Pooja puffed her first ciggie at 23, has never done cocaine but she was drinking by the age of 16. She grew up in an Anglo-Indian environment, where it was normal for wine to be passed around the table. Also, in the film industry, people would drink merrily.She ended her marriage, two years ago. When the 10-year relationship ended, she didn't give herself time to mourn, she moved on with alcohol by her side. ""I was born to a man who has never done anything in half measures and I inherited that. So when I drank, I drank copiously. Your appetite increases even as the alcohol does terrible things to your body, clutters your mind and colours your judgement of the people you're hanging out with,"" she said.Pooja has witnessed what alcohol did to her father and it's effect on his marriage. She was in a relationship with an alcoholic, and she lost a friend at 40 to alcohol as well, and drank to mourn her. But when her father had urged her to look after herself, she looked into the mirror and realised she had a problem at hand. ""I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down,"" she explained to the tabloid.She further adds, ""Luckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. I'm in the pink of health except for the weight I put on because I'm now a stressful producer. But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one,"" she says.Unlike most, Pooja didn't need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had her dad and her director friend Kaustav Narayan Niyogi, who acted as her support system. Though she's quit alcohol for good, she doesn't have an issue being around people who drink, plus she has a well-stocked bar at home and pours drinks for friends. ""If I can't be around alcohol and resist it, it means I'm not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I'd be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from your life,"" she says.",https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-pooja-bhatt-reveals-what-made-her-banish-alcohol-from-her-life-2339974
Positive thinking: Real alcoholics,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2012-02-07T05:33:00,"The real alcoholic may start off as a moderate drinker; he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor consumption.Here is the fellow who has been puzzling you, especially in his lack of control. He does absurd, incredible, tragic things while drinking. He is a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is always more or less insanely drunk. His disposition while drinking resembles his normal nature but little. He may be one of the finest fellows in the world. Yet let him drink for a day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social.He has a positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly when some important decision must be made or engagement kept. He is often perfectly sensible and well balanced concerning everything except liquor, but in that respect he is incredibly dishonest and selfish.As matters grow worse, he begins to use a combination of high-powered sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go to work. Then comes the day when he simply cannot make it and gets drunk all over again. Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.This is by no means a comprehensive picture of the true alcoholic, as our behaviour patterns vary. But this description should identify him roughly.Why does he behave like this? If hundreds of experiences have shown him that one drink means another debacle with all its attendant suffering and humiliation, why is it he takes that one drink?We know that while the alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for months or years, he reacts much like other men. We are equally positive that once he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something happens, both in the bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually impossible for him to stop.These observations would be academic and pointless if our friend never took the first drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion. Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body.Reprinted from the Big Book, Alcoholics Anonymous, pages 21-23, with permission of AA World Services, Inc.Got a drinking problem?

Her husband threw her out of home and even her children abandoned her. For the 55-year-old alcoholic, life meant managing to live till the next drink. Soon, she was on the streets with no money to buy alcohol. Craving for a drink, and not able to afford it, she tried to end her life.For Mallamma, who had failed as wife, mother and a human being, the suicide was yet another failure. She didn’t die. Someone kind took her to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Two sessions at the NGO, and Malamma began at what what had become of her. It wasn’t easy, but at least she began to cope.It’s been three years now. Mallamma hasn’t had a drink. Her family took her back and she lives with her 10 grand- children. She appears as happy as a 58-year-old can be.Mallamma is one of the lucky ones among women alcohol addicts in the city. In a city of 80 lakh, the number of female alcoholics would be more than the mere 20 registered with AA.A team of 63 women members of AA from Australia, USA, Russia, Virgin Islands and New Zealand, visited Bangalore on Wednesday.“The social stigma attached towards alcoholism in women is the same across the world. Their families are ashamed and rejected them, resulting in the death of many due to alcoholism. The cases don’t even come to light,” said Louise Dunne, a member of the AA, Australia.In many cases, the families feel ashamed to take them for therapy and confine them to home.“This leads to more alcoholism. The families are fine with them being alcoholics but are ashamed to send them for therapy. Families need to help them and take them to therapy. We at AA don’t have a stance on alcoholism. We help only those who come to us,” said Vanda Rounsell, another member of AA.If the number of urban women who registered for AA’s programme are few, it is worse with rural women, said another member of AA.However, the delegation from abroad has an agenda to help AA in India to help them in dealing with alcoholism in women.AA members are also teaching members here to take each day at a time. “This is called relapse prevention in medical terms. It is to ensure that you don’t drink for 24 hours and then meet the group.

‘Say no to drinking today’,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2009-01-19T02:19:00,"Youngsters are taking to drinking at an early age. The average age for alcohol consumption has come down from 19 years to 15 years in the last couple of years. An average rural man spends about 24 per cent of his income on alcohol while the urban man spends around 32 per cent. Eighty per cent of hospital admissions occur due to alcohol consumption directly or indirectly. These were some of the startling figures shared at an event organised by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) recently. It witnessed the presence of Leonard Blumenthal, a non alcoholic friend of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and chairman A.A. US/ Canada to address this very grave problem of alcoholism. This being his first trip to India, he plans to hold meetings in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Bangalore before heading back to Canada.Blumenthal, who was nominated a class A trustee of the General Service Board, AA in the year 2000 became the chairman of the same in 2005.Class A trustees are those who have never been alcoholics while class B trustees comprise recovering alcoholics. Blumenthal started his career as a teacher, then got interested in alcoholism and addiction and worked with the government helping them set up counselling centres and conduct counselling programmes. He then got introduced to AA and decided to become a part of it.He says, “AA has changed the lives of many people but still more awareness is needed.”AA is a voluntary fellowship that takes no money or grants from anyone. It runs only on the contribution of the members. “Even I am not allowed to contribute as I am not an alcoholic,” says Blumenthal. The members are not made to register or sign any form. They are free to come when they want. “At the meetings no one tells others what to do. They merely share their experiences, which acts as an inspiration,” he says.Blumenthal adds, “No one here says we will completely stop drinking. They only decide not to drink today. And as this decision is made everyday, a gradual change takes place.”He believes that the most difficult step is to accept that one is an alcoholic. After that it is to decide you want to change. Jo-Anne, a class B trustee of AA says that she was the second from her group of friends to come to AA and has been sober for many years now. “AA has been responsible for many miracles like mine,” says Jo-Anne.The statistics as regards alcohol consumption are alarming, with about 350 million deaths occurring worldwide every year due to alcohol consumption. AA is trying to do its bit and is slowly expanding to reach many more people. Today it is present in 180 countries and there are about 850 groups in India. There is more than one AA meeting occurring in Mumbai everyday.The event also saw celebrities Pooja Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt grace the occasion.",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-say-no-to-drinking-today-1222669
Bangalore chapter of AA turns 45,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2009-06-22T10:22:00,"Shiv slides out his mobile phone from his pocket and shows me a promotional SMS he just received: If you suffer from diabetes, skin disease, gastric problems, alcoholism, backache or body pains, call our clinic.“If kicking an alcohol addiction was so easy, there’d be no Alcoholics Anonymous,” he chuckles. Speaking honestly of the first time he visited an AA meeting, he says that he stepped in just for “timepass.” But successfully sober for eight years now, he admits that it’s given him more than just sobriety: “A rich kid, I had everything I needed, yet was emotionally bankrupt.” So when I became a part of a support group, I understood that my drinking problem was more of a dealing-with-life problem. Here, I was never judged, only understood. This, at a time when all my so-called friends had left me.” He also believes that alcohol is just a symptom of a greater problem. Agreeing with Shiv is Gopal, chairman, AA Intergroup, Bangalore, “Alcohol in alcoholism isn’t as much the problem as the ‘ism’.” He also says that the main aim of AA is to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. Informing that AA is a self-supporting group that doesn’t accept funds from outside, he says, “Everyone helping out and volunteering is recovering or has had a drinking problem. We never forget where we have come from and our past that once haunted us turns into an asset, that’s the beauty of AA.”Shriya, another alcoholic, reveals what kept her coming, “No one is told what they should do. There aren’t any set of rules or judgments. Somehow, when everyone called me a burden, I was accepted here.” She also clarifies that anonymity isn’t because anyone is embarrassed, but it’s part of the “traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous” penned by founder Bill Wilson in 1934. “Staying anonymous helps us stay humble and not take credit for our recovery. After all, we couldn’t do it ourselves in the first place,” she says.For those who are still wrestling with the bottle, Shriya urges that the first step is to accept you have a problem and take that baby step of attending a meeting. Transformed and sober, with tears filling up her eyes, she says, “I came home for the first time, when I came to AA.”",https://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-chapter-of-aa-turns-45-1267303

A few are fortunate enough to be so situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.If we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt that much good will result, but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched. Those of us who live in large cities are overcome by the reflection that close by hundreds are dropping into oblivion every day. Many could recover if they had the opportunity we have enjoyed. How then shall we present that which has been so freely given us?We have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience and knowledge. This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a drinking problem.Of necessity there will have to be discussion of matters medical, psychiatric, social, and religious. We are aware that these matters are, from their very nature, controversial. Most of us sense that real tolerance of other people’s shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us more useful to others. Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.You may already have asked yourself why it is that all of us became so very ill from drinking. Doubtless you are curious to discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body.

But when you learn to live without any addiction, life becomes beautiful, transforming you to become a meaningful individual.This was an experience echoed by women members of international delegations of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) who have recovered from addiction and those of Nishigandh in Pune. Nishigandh is the ward started by Muktangan rehabilitation centre and celebrated its fourth anniversary on Friday.De-addicted women from Australia and US narrated their life stories. They started consuming alcohol and became so addicted that they could not leave it. In the process, they became bad wives and their husbands left them. They became bad mothers and their children left them or they had to leave the children.After joining AA they all could leave addiction and become good human beings. All the women said they were happy to become meaningful members of society and were proud mothers and grandmothers after getting de-addicted.One of the members of Nishigandh expressed the resolve to take up de-addiction work as at Nishigandh as a career, resulting in applause from all.

Beating that compulsion on the plate,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2009-07-21T08:51:00,"This year, the Overeaters Anonymous (OA) group in Bangalore completes 10 years of its existence. In case if you never considered overeating as a disease, well, it is. “A compulsive eating disorder,” as its members like to put it.“It’s about filling a void – be it physical, mental or spiritual,” says Prem, one of the founding members of the group. Based on the same principles as that of Alcoholics Anonymous, the group consists of 20 members who have made it a point to help each other through the challenge. “You really don’t know when and how it happens,” says Tanushree, a member for the last five years, “but it is something you turn to without being conscious of it.” She is also a member of Alcoholics Anonymous: “An addiction is an addiction. It could be food, it could be alcohol.”While an addiction with alcohol involves the addict having to wean himself off it altogether, an addiction with food can only be helped by having the person eat in moderation. “It’s food. No one can abstain from it, unlike with alcohol,” says Prem.The youngest member of the group, Sandesh, who is now 16, was introduced to OA by his father as a 10-year-old: “If there were five people at a table, I would eat more than any of them would.” When he started to gain weight, it also led to breathing problems.“As we are quite vigilant with what we eat, he did not snack too much in between meals. But he accepted it as a disease once I recognised it. He had the tendency to overeat whether we were at a buffet service or having our regular meals at home,” his father, Jaideep says. He explains that it is a condition where the brain fails to send across the right signals indicating that the amount of food being eaten is enough.At the meetings, the members affirm their conviction in the 12 steps as with AA, followed by a session where they share their experiences with one another. Most addicts do not have particular cravings but tend to overeat in general. As for a cure, there is none. “It is a life-long problem,” admits Jaideep. “OA isn’t about losing weight. The meetings help you understand your problem and take the necessary steps,” says Sandesh who has managed to keep a check on his eating habits. The teenager hits the gym regularly, likes to cook and so fixes a meal by himself whenever time allows him to, and loves to read.Unlike popular belief, it has little to do with being a release of pent-up stress. Neither is there room for self-hate here. “Once a person becomes aware, he can build strategies,” says Jaideep. It varies from member to member too. So while one member might call up a friend and ask him to keep a check on him while he heads for the buffet counter for a second serving, Jaideep says his son has his own set of regulations. “I make sure I don’t take a second helping. It helps me know that when the food on my plate finishes, I am full and do not need anymore,” notes Sandesh. He also resorts to eating a fruit when hungry and then moves to a regular meal: “That way, I can ensure I am eating healthily.”The group, as with AA, uses the tools of anonymity, meetings, literature, sponsorship, service etc and is free of cost.(Names have been changed to protect identities)OA meetings are held at St Mark’s Road.

The only requirement for membership is a desire to stay clean.The Pune branch is active in its support and has weekly meetings at five locations in the city. The anonymity of the members as well as their struggle to stay clean is respected at the centre.Area service committee chairman, Indrajit D, told DNA, “We treat drug abuse as a symptom of flawed personality. The members try and change their personality traits or mindsets that led them to the addiction.”According to Indrajit, this is an effective way of ensuring that the members stay clean and reduce the chances of relapse.Indrajit said, “Support groups and sponsors are important when peer pressure is involved. Peer pressure is a common reason for the growing number of young drug users. The average age of members of NA in Pune is 25 years with the youngest at 18.“Drugs are associated with the rock star image for most youngsters. But in reality, it can lead to committing crimes and living on the streets,” he added.The shared experiences at NA are designed to dispel the illusion of glamour.The fellowship has approached colleges and universities.

Four years ago, however, if someone had met him, he would not have recognised the man.At the tender age of 16, a schoolmate introduced Naresh to alcohol, and there was no going back. He started drinking day and night, somehow hiding the habit from his parents, and soon he was a raging alcoholic. When money became an issue, he stole and sold off household goods such as fan, chair, remote, pressure cooker, and gas stove.“It started with one peg a day and soon I was gulping down 10 pegs daily. I had started to walk an extremely dangerous path. I was a bright student but just barely passed both Class X and XII board exams. I could see that my family was really worried, but nothing stopped me from drinking,” recalls Naresh, now 24.After suffering for four years, he was finally sent to a rehabilitation centre, where doctors directed him to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a group working for the people with a drinking problem.“I was not willing to go for any of the sessions. The first few sessions were torture. Everyone in the room was talking about their drinking habit and how they got into it. Slowly, I started listening to them and suddenly I could see my entire life. I realised how dark my future was and how I was making it worse. Then I began to open up,” says Naresh, who is now an AA volunteer himself.AA is a global fellowship of men and women who once had a drinking problem. It is non-professional, self-supporting, non-denominational, apolitical, and services are available almost everywhere. There are no age or educational requirements to become a volunteer. Membership is open to anyone who wants to get rid of the habit.There are more than 20 AA centres In India itself, where meetings for the alcoholics are organised.“We advise people to come continuously for 90 days. We all sit together and share our experiences. We suggest a few ways to get rid of the habit. Not all manage to quit alcohol but there are great success stories as well,” says Shiv Sharma, another volunteer, who had first come to the centre to get help.Delhi alone has more than 2,000 AA volunteers, who are now helping others.Sharma was 27 when he first came to AA. He had lost his job due to excessive drinking. The loss of employment depressed him further and brought him closer to alcohol. Life had turned into hell.“Both my younger brothers got married and I was just sitting in my room, consuming alcohol. I used to howl while drinking, but couldn’t stop myself,” he says.

Rachel Lehnardt, a 36-year-old was slapped with six years of probation and $600 fine after being found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.The 36-year-old reportedly had sex with an 18-year-old in a toilet at the party. Rachel Lehnardt allowed her teen daughter and her friends to drink and smoke weed in her home and they ended up playing a naked version of a game called Twister. She then masturbated with sex toys in front of the teenagers and then woke up to find herself being raped by a 16-year-old boy, who was her daughter's boyfriend. When she told Alcoholics Anonymous about the episode, she was reported to the authorities.Reportedly, no charges are pending against the 16-year-old boy and she is not being charged for having sex with the 18-year-old because the age of consent in Georgia, USA is 16.Her daughter defended the move on Twitter saying, everyone makes mistakes, and Lehnardt’s lawyer said: “Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct. Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counselling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.”The statement added that she only started drinking after her divorce to her husband and committed herself to her faith and her family.",https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-drunk-woman-accuses-daughter-s-minor-boyfriend-of-raping-her-at-house-party-nsfw-2231885

Stigma and non-acceptance from family and society is not letting them get help, due to which female de-addiction wards run empty and were eventually shut down.Dr Shubhangi Parker, assistant dean (academics) at KEM Hospital, said, “An alcoholic man will still be respected by his family and the women in his life will motivate him to take up treatment. However, this is not the case with an alcoholic woman. She is not extended help with same intensity and commitment.”She further added that the stigma attached with being alcoholic, and rejection from the family and society are major roadblocks in their treatment. “We were the first to start a seven-bedded female de-addiction ward in 1991. But with no women coming forward, we had to shut it down.”Agreeing with Dr Parker, Dr Yusuf Matcheswalla, psychiatrist attached with Masina hospital, said, “While the number of women alcoholics have gone up, the female de-addiction centres had no takers and we were forced to close it. They prefer to be admitted at places on the outskirts of Mumbai.”Doctors say urbanisation and changing social norms could have lead to more women taking up drinking.Talking about the challenges in dealing with treating women alcoholics, Dr Matcheswalla said, “Women don’t want to come out in the open about their problem, and the chance of a relapse is higher in women than in men, due to socio-emotional factors.”An Alcoholics Anonymous member who has successfully quit drinking said, “I was a successful working woman. I don’t know when I turned alcoholic. It has been three years and three months since I have stopped drinking. Being a woman, I was always questioned why I started drinking to get addicted and then went for de-addiction. Women drinking is a big taboo. People will label her, but not extend help,” the woman said.",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-rise-in-number-of-women-drinking-get-no-help-1793282

It is just the beginning, you know what I mean, in their eyes. My life has changed, but I’m still a little bit wobbly. I am taking it one day at a time.”Surrounded by reporters and a dozen photographers, Doherty, 28, said he just wanted to ‘get out on the road with the boys’ to play more music with his band Babyshambles.Thames Magistrates Court in east London heard that Doherty had been making good progress in his fight against drugs.The review hearing was held to gauge his progress in drug rehabilitation after a string of court appearances in recent months. Doherty has spent two days a week in voluntary drug rehabilitation and has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.Magistrate Jane McIvor cancelled the last six months of his forced rehabilitation which was compulsory under the court order.“I am going to revoke the last six months of the order,” she said. “There is no need for any statutory supervision or state funding because the plan that’s already in place, the experts have convinced me, is going to be followed.”Asked to comment on his progress, Doherty, wearing a black suit and tie, told the court, “Yeah (I am) quite proud really, it’s the beginning.” His lawyer Sean Curran told the court it was a ‘long road ahead’ which has just started.The singer, who had an on-off relationship with the model Kate Moss, has been repeatedly arrested for drugs offences in recent months.",https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-doherty-vows-to-stay-off-drugs-1129644

Given the evils of drinking, it is important that groups that help people stay clean become more visible and reach out to all the sections of the society.At the 49th anniversary function of the Bangalore chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on Sunday, former DG&IGP of Karnataka ST Ramesh said the support group should be proactive in offering help to women. Ramesh, a Class-A Trustee of AA, said the group should reach out to more women and raise awareness on the downside of taking to alcohol.The former top cop said that about half of the country’s population comprises women, but rarely do members of the fairer sex come forward to seek help from groups like the AA. He said the fellowship should reach out to the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) population too.Ramesh said while it was a matter of pride that the group was going into its golden jubilee year, it should strive to make itself friendlier and more approachable for women. He said it was not enough for the AA to paste stickers on bus stands or other public places, it needs to reach all sections of the society that need help, including politicians.At the event, those trying to shake off alcohol addiction shared their tale of misery, fightback and the challenges on the path to staying clean. Ramesh advised people not to get complacent, reminding that theirs was a daily struggle.He asked them not to forget the 12 steps recommended by the AA, no matter how long they stay sober.“Being sober is as important as breathing to a recovering alcoholic,” he said.",https://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-not-many-women-addicted-to-booze-seek-help-1855525

KR believes that addiction leads to loss of health, catching fatal diseases, bad family life, tarnishing the social image of the addict, increase in expenditure on medical account for the corporation and also leads to loss of man-days.According to a KR official, the number of these employees is very few and forms a mere 0.5% of the total manpower strength of the railway. But, in order to help such employees come out of the ill and contribute positively to the growth of the corporation, the chairman and managing director of KR, Bhanu Prakash Tayal, started the drive all over KR.The alcohol de-addiction drive for the employees was started on April 15, 2013, by identifying such employees. An awareness programme was held for these employees in cooperation with Alcoholics Anonymous, followed by weekly sessions.The addicted employees are also provided counselling by a qualified counsellor.

The representatives interacted with and encouraged each other at the novel event.Sandhya Gupta, Psychiatrist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS), said: ""Most rehabilitation and de-addiction organisations in India do not follow the biological approach. They try to resolve addiction with the viewpoint of psychology. What we need now is to treat the addiction just like any other disease.""""Every organisation should follow the harm minimisation process for detoxification. Stopping drugs immediately can have very hazardous effects on a patient's body. The long process of detoxification should start with the addict switching from illegal drugs to legal ones. Then the amount of consumption of legal drugs should be decreased, followed by rehabilitation,"" Dr Sandhya added.Praveen Katyal, a volunteer with a de-addiction centre, shared his own experience: ""I didn't realise that I was a chronic alcoholic till my body got so used to liquor that I could not even walk without it. Despite being an educated professional, I was looked upon with hatred and disgust. """" When people are affected by a disease, they are given complete care and love. But when I was going through de-addiction and rehabilitation process, even my friends and relatives didn't care for me. The rejection by family members is very dangerous, because the family's support can really boost an addict's morale ,"" said Sumit Verma, a member of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).

Solace in numbersGokhale says living with cancer wouldn’t have been the same had it not been for the support group at the Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA), an NGO that works for the welfare of cancer patients . “I had lost hair and wore a wig after chemotherapy. At my first support group meeting, I bent down to pick up something and my wig fell off. It wasn’t uncommon, yet I froze and looked around — not a soul reacted, forget snigger at it,” remembers Gokhale.Instead, someone suggested she should do away with wigs and buy matching bandanas with her salwar kameezes.Just as no two cancers are the same, no two patients are the same, explains Shubha Maudgal of the CPAA. “You spend most of your time doing the rounds of doctors who may not even have the time to address your doubts, forget about clearing myths and fears — cancer is, after all, a complicated problem,” she says. Patients feel everything’s out of control and obsess about their course of treatment and its effects, she adds.CPAA runs two support groups — for children suffering from cancer, and for women suffering from breast cancer. “You can imagine how little the scope is to answer personal, and sometimes, embarrassing questions about cancer — pertaining to your sex life, the disturbing changes in your body, and so on. A support group lets you know you’re not alone and someone or the other has a solution to everything you’ve been facing alone till that point,” says Maudgal.Transformation from withinSeven years ago, at an all-time low, Ruchi Bhimani, now 32, was in severe depression following a relationship problem. Her career was going nowhere, even as she struggled to get over her emotional dependency issues. But today, she is a successful line producer working on a feature film.Looking back, she realises she has managed to achieve many things she earlier didn’t think she was capable of. Her transformation came about after she joined the Soka Gokkai, a Buddhist support group.Interacting with the other members of the group, she explains, not only helped her become emotionally independent, but also gave her the courage and strength to challenge her own limits. She describes it as a network of friendship, where the bonds between the members grow deep, instead of serving as a superficial venting session. By chanting alongside the other members, and trying to bring about positive change, not just in her own life but for a better world, Bhimani feels she was able to reach out and help transform the lives of many other people as well.As Ritu, a Mumbai-based member, puts it, “The practice, more than anything else, helps people believe in their inherent potential.”‘You are not being judged’It is hard to assist those who suffer from alcoholism because of the nature of the problem — most of them are in denial about the extent of their addiction, as well as the toll it is taking on their well-being. Their families, often the silent sufferers, are forced to take matters into their own hands.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is synonymous with addiction recovery.. Says Arun Shalar, head of the Mumbai branch, “We conduct group therapy with our meetings which are held daily at our centre.” The AA meetings do not require any fee or registration.Anonymity is of utmost importance to a patient, believes Shalar.“People from every social and economic background attend these meetings — these include those who have lost their jobs, corporate CEOs, chartered accountants and housewives.”The workshops include one-on-one therapy, as the AA creed holds that support from a recovered alcoholic provides a unique support system. The members share their experiences and are encouraged to bring their family along for participation. “Our meetings are autonomous and people can attend at their own convenience,” says Shalar. “There is a stigma attached to alcoholism. At our meetings, the patient can discuss his problems without fear of judgement.”For more information about the CPAA support group, call 2492 8775; for Soka Gakkai email bsg@bharatsokagakkai.org; and call Alcoholics Anonymous at 23075134",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-you-can-get-strength-from-sharing-1415630

Anthony Hopkins’ saviour reveals how he beat booze by aiding others,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1381424.jpg,2010-05-10T15:45:46,"The man who helped save Sir Anthony Hopkins battle his booze nightmare has revealed how he came to the star’s rescue.Clancy Imislund, a former alcoholic who helps the homeless battle their addictions in Los Angeles, has spoken of how he came to the Oscar-winning actor’s aid when he was still coming to terms with life without alcohol after quitting the bottle in the mid-seventies.“I knew he was an actor but he wasn’t as big then as he is now. I’d just been straight a lot longer than him and decided I’d teach him the little technical things to help you get through the problems of everyday life without wanting to take a swig of the strong stuff,” the Daily Express quoted Clancy, 83, as saying.The Welshman’s drink problem took hold when his stage and film career started taking off in the Sixties.And the actor finally took things in his hands after his move to the US in December 1975 when, after waking up hundreds of miles away from his home in an Arizona hotel room with no recollection of how he got there, he decided to quit the bottle for good.Hopkins went on to join Alcoholics Anonymous and it was there that he met Clancy, who offered him a piece of advice that ensured he would not fall off the wagon.Clancy is a former advertising executive whose career was wrecked by drink before he rebuilt his life to become managing director of the Midnight Mission.“The thing with alcoholism is that it makes you very self-obsessed, it’s all ‘me, me, me,’” explained Clancy.“Put 10 guys in a room and, by next week, maybe six will be gone. But I could tell Tony really wanted to stick with it. So I told him if he really wanted to help himself, the only way to do it was to help others,” he added.Hopkins, now 72, went on to become a volunteer at the Midnight Mission.Each Christmas he hands out presents to the homeless and has even taken time out to teach free acting classes.“It’s funny. We have film nights here and one time we showed Silence Of The Lambs. So as a surprise I asked Tony to come down and tap a few people on the shoulder at the end and say ‘Hello’ in that voice he does. You should have seen their faces. They were like, ‘Arrggh!’ He got a real kick out of that,” said Clancy.",https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-anthony-hopkins-saviour-reveals-how-he-beat-booze-by-aiding-others-1381422

Actually, it has resulted in a decline in the number of female students seeking admission to FTII,"" he told PTI.Kainthola, who succeeded Prashant Pathrabe recently, said alcoholism too was taking toll on the health of the students and that he had also ""heard"" of instances of drug abuse on the campus.""We are going to have a zero tolerance policy for all this.

The clinic, founded in 1997 and upgraded by the WHO in 2002, aims to address this need, said doctors at the hospital.“Tobacco users are assessed for the various psycho-social aspects influencing their tobacco habit. Scientific knowledge on the ill-effects of tobacco use is also imparted here,” said Dr Gauravi Mishra, consultant in preventive oncology at the hospital, who helps run the clinic.But there is no miracle pill at the centre which can help you quit the habit all of a sudden, she clarified. Instead, the process involves individual and group counselling.“Counselling intervention offered at the clinic aims at initiating the thinking process among tobacco users regarding their own barriers to tobacco cessation and facilitating a decision to quit tobacco. Group counselling the family of the tobacco addict reinforces the ‘quit’ habit and ensures compliance,” Dr Mishra said.According to oncologists at the hospital, there are two major hurdles faced by the clinic — lack of awareness and absence of follow-up treatment. “While de-addiction centres like the Alcoholics Anonymous are well-known and are visited by a lot of people who want to give up alcohol, awareness about a tobacco cessation clinic is very low,” said Dr Mishra.“The other problem is that we don’t get good follow-up of patients as most come to Tata from across the country, as well as abroad. For tobacco cessation, good follow-up is necessary,” said Dr Mishra.",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-butt-stops-at-cessation-clinic-in-tata-hospital-1389976
Is cricket turning you into a SHIT?,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2012-12-01T09:30:00,"I’ve finally decided to start a self-help group for the Indian cricket fan who, despite being in constant pain, is unable to wean himself off the game.Modelled on Alcoholics Anonymous, it will be called Suckers Hurt by Indian Team (SHIT). Members of the group will gather on alternate Fridays in an empty classroom or an available conference room. Each speaker will start by saying something like, 'My name is Sampath and I am a sucker hurt by the Indian team,' before going on to share his/her horror stories about obsessively watching cricket and irrationally supporting Team India and the extreme suffering and self-flagellation they’ve had to endure on account of being an Indian cricket fan.Regular readers of this column would know by now my views on jingoism, idol-worship, nationalism and flag-waving. And yet, when it comes to cricket and Team India, it's as if some primal neurological reflex kicks in – a bit like VVS Laxman outside off-stump – and I go fishing for some vicarious glory that every rational cell in my body knows is simply me asking for the spectatorial equivalent of water-boarding.But then, isn’t that how addiction works? Your intellectual comprehension of the utter stupidity of expecting some happiness from watching a game of cricket is powerless to save you from subjecting yourself to another session of pulling your hair out in frustration. (Now you know what happened to the hair on my head – yes, the BCCI took it. You can see it on display at the CCI.)I've been following the game for a quarter of a century. Guess what, I’ve also been trying to stop following the game for a quarter of a century. But I realised recently that I have the same problem as Sachin Tendulkar – can't call it quits though I know it's time to do so. And this is not surprising, for Sachin and I go back a long way.As a school boy, around the time Sachin was putting together that marathon partnership with Vinod Kambli for Sharadashram Vidyamandir, I wasted my afternoons following North Zone versus East Zone on the radio. I nearly flunked my class XII Boards because I couldn't not watch every single game of the 1992 World Cup which, held in February-March, clashed precisely with the one-month 'study leave' you got to prepare for the exams.In college, there was a phase where I would watch the whole game, from 9am to 5pm or whatever, if it was an ODI, then catch the highlights at seven or eight at night, and then watch the video-recording of the match from ten till five in the morning, managing just two hours of sleep before waking up to go for my classes.My cricket addiction reached its peak during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. I think I must be one of the few elite losers on the planet who managed to watch every single match of this tournament live, including the Canada, Namibia and Holland matches, and then followed it up by reading all the World Cup-related coverage in three newspapers, memorising the scorecards and fall of wickets and bowling figures and the number of maidens and no balls and wides delivered by bowlers who I didn’t even know existed until the World Cup, like Sanjayan Thuraisingam, for instance.Of course, those were the years of magical thinking, which usually centred on a boy with the curly hair and the straight bat. Even if India was decimated, and literally had its nose rubbed in the grass, as happened almost every time we played abroad, you at least had the satisfaction of watching a Sachin straight drive; or a Sachin leg glance, or at least a Sachin adjusting his crotch guard by doing half-squats, which was still an endearing novelty in those days.But then, there comes a time when every Indian cricket fan has to confront the reality of being a SHIT, and for me, that time is long past. In my 25 years of cricket addiction, four things have not changed: one, BCCI’s mismanagement; two, the inevitable degeneration of fresh-faced, noble talent into selfish, greedy mediocrities who take the team down by holding on to their places long past their sell-by date; three, idiotic team selections, and four, our infinite genius for conjuring defeats no matter how strong our talent pool, how favourable the conditions, or how weak the opposition.The ongoing series, where we should have been on our way to thump the Englishmen 4-0 but are now likely to go 1-2 down, is the 33,970th time (that’s one more than the runs scored by Sachin in Tests and ODIs together) I’m telling myself, 'Buddy, give up! Stop being a SHIT!'So all you SHITs who want to make it to the first SHIT meeting, mail me and I'll send you the venue details. Until then, if you really have to watch a sport, my advice: stick to beach volleyball.The writer is reachable at sampath4office@gmail.com.",https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-is-cricket-turning-you-into-a-shit-1771889

Compared to heavier themes like female foeticide and other social ills, the much-spoken-of topic of alcoholism might seem trivial to some.A chillingly candid interview with Vijay Simha puts a human face on the misery brought about by alcohol addiction while the enlightening interview with Dr Ashish Deshpande dismissed the myth that it’s the habits of the sufferer that landed him in the mire.Its hard not to flinch at Simha’s booze-soaked decline after having touched the pinnacle of success in journalism -- from working as the executive editor of a reputed daily to languishing for weeks in a public toilet where neither cleaners nor flies would venture. After alienating friends and family, and compromising his dignity along the way, it is a heartening experience to watch the man rise above it all, telling his tale.Though the unseemly, sometimes bizarre, actions of men under the influence sometimes invited laughter from the audience, the genetic nitty-gritty of addiction that differentiate those struck by the disease from those who aren’t was very succinctly explained by Dr Deshpande, earned their rapt attention.As did the story of another man identified only as Laxman, who spent a whopping Rs40 lakh in hospital bills to seek some relief after decades of liquor pangs. His lesson that while hospitals could only purge his body, but not mind, of alcohol makes a powerful case for the importance of Alcoholics Anonymous -- which proved to be his saviour -- in smoking out the disease.Perhaps to those who don’t display the text-book symptoms, overlooking the ruination to the life of a casual acquaintance or distant family member, one’s drinking is a personal, harmless thing. Not so, according to psychiatrist Dr Vivek Benegal, whose shocking statistics revealed that half of India’s liquor-drinking population do harm to themselves by exceeding their limit (Four pegs, by international standards).Lastly, with the introduction of Sumir Anand, who lost his son Curran to a drunk driver, the episode effectively showed how irresponsible drinking matched with overall irresponsible behaviour creates a problem which assumes society-threatening proportions. Going so far as to question the manner with which the perpetrator of the offence was let off called viewers to question the strictness with which the law was dealing with the menace.Aamir Khan, keeping things cool, refrained from being high-handed and this episode, far from self-indulgent, only has the potential to induce reflection and open many drenched minds to intervention.We’ll drink to it!",https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/review-review-three-cheers-for-satyamev-jayate-episode-9-1709262

Prosecutor Shane Krauser had recommended one year in prison, saying that Tyson was a multiple offender who previously had been convicted of a violent crime and that only now has he sought treatment for his drug addiction.""Judge, by my calculations, this is his fourth or fifth chance,"" Krauser said.The latest charges stemmed from a traffic stop in Scottsdale on December 29 after the boxer had spent the evening at Scottsdale's Pussycat Lounge and was seen driving erratically. An officer said he saw Tyson wiping a white substance off the dashboard of his black BMW, and that his speech was slurred.Authorities said they found bags of cocaine in Tyson's pocket and in his car.Tyson told officers later that he used cocaine ""whenever I can get my hands on it,"" and that he preferred to smoke it in Marlboro cigarettes with the tobacco pulled out, according to court documents.He also told police that he used marijuana that day and was taking the antidepressant Zoloft, the documents state.Since his arrest, Tyson checked himself into an inpatient treatment program for what his lawyer called ""various addictions.""Tyson attorney David Chesnoff said his client had taken 29 drug tests without a relapse since his arrest and that he's attended Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings.Two of Tyson's former wives also wrote letters to the court asking for leniency.Abrams yesterday said that she was impressed that Tyson was seeking therapy for his drug addiction. ""You worked to address your addiction and self-destructive behavior,"" Abrams said.In addition to probation, Tyson also will have to pay a fine and serve 360 hours of community service, including at least 20 hours per month.County Attorney Andrew Thomas had said after the plea was entered that Tyson should be put in prison, noting that Tyson was convicted of rape in Indiana in 1992 and pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland in 1999.In 1986, Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history when, at 20, he knocked out Trevor Berbick.

They all enjoy easy access to liquor; for some, driving back home after a few drinks is an unremarkable routine. All college-going students DNA spoke to said they have never been asked to produce liquor permits.Neha Sharma (20), who is pursuing a post-graduation course in public relations from St Xavier’s, has been partying for more than six years. She has never been denied a drink, be it in a local wine shop or at a pub. “I have been to most pubs in south Mumbai, but I have never been asked for any documentation,” she said. “But I make sure that someone sober is at the wheel when we drive home.” Her parents are unaware of her indulgence.Jay Adhikari, a former student of National College, has no parental issues about liquor. “I was 16 when I first had booze at home at a party,” he said. “My father’s cousin offered me a drink; that’s how I began. Now I drink with friends about thrice a month. My parents know about it.”Jay said availability of liquor has never been a problem at any of the discotheques and pubs he frequents. “I remember going to a disco in Khar when I was 17,” he said. “No one asked me for age proof.”Jay, like Neha, is careful about making his way back home after a party. He said he usually has a driver for such occasions, or takes public transport. “I always play it safe,” he said. “It’s not that one cannot drive after drinking; one just has to be in one’s senses.” Jay said he does not condone drunken driving. “My friends do drink and drive,” he said. “No matter what you tell them, you cannot make them understand.”Gautam Adhiyal, 23, also had an early start to a life of revelry. This software engineer had his first taste of liquor at home. “I was 14 when my cousin offered a drink at a birthday party,” he said. “Two hours later, I started drinking with my friends. We have never been asked for any papers at any pub so far.”Gautam said that although it was commonplace to see people driving under the influence, he exercises caution after parties. “I always ensure that someone sober is driving, or we hire a cab or a rickshaw. I don’t take chances.”Jatin Daruka, 23, who once attended St Xavier College, has no such qualms. “I have been drinking since I was 14,” Jatin said.“And I have been driving while drunk for some time now because that gives me a kick.” Jatin said his parents know he is an ‘occasional drinker’.According to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), few youngsters seek counselling because they are not willing to accept their addiction. “Most youngsters are bought in by their parents,” an AA spokesman said. “But we do get calls from young people aged between 18 and 24.” Twenty-one is the legal drinking age.“The most calls come from Borivli and Andheri,” the spokesman said.(Some names have been changed)",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-give-me-a-vodka-and-a-jar-of-acne-cream-1064352
CBS axes 'Two and a Half Men' after Charlie Sheen insults,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1512601.jpg,2011-02-25T15:05:59,"Television network CBS on Thursday canceled production of its top-rated comedy Two and A Half Men for the rest of the season after star Charlie Sheen unleashed an expletive-filled attack on the show's producer.The decision came days before Sheen, the highest-paid actor on US television, was due to return to the set following his third stint in rehab in 12 months.Production of Two and a Half Men was suspended in January when Sheen, 45, was persuaded to seek help after a wild 36-hour party at his home that ended with him being hospitalized.In an interview on a syndicated radio program and in remarks to celebrity website TMZ.com, on Thursday Sheen called Two and A Half Men producer and co-creator Chuck Lorre a ""charlatan (who) chose not to do his job,"" a ""piece of shit"" and a ""stupid, stupid little man.""Sheen also belittled Alcoholics Anonymous and claimed he had cured himself ""with my mind"" after four weeks of drug and alcohol treatment at his home.""Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Bros.Television have decided to discontinue production of Two and a Half Men for the remainder of the season,"" the network and the show''s makers said in a statement.Sheen swiftly fired back in an open letter, given to TMZ.com, referring again to Lorre in a derogatory fashion.""I urge all my beautiful and loyal fans who embraced this show for almost a decade to walk with me side-by-side as we march up the steps of justice to right this unconscionable wrong,"" Sheen added.Four of the final eight episodes for the current TV season, ending in May, already had been axed due to the hiatus.Two and a Half Men is a huge money generator for the broadcaster and production company, and earlier this year the network said it was ""highly concerned"" about Sheen. CBS is a unit of CBS Corp and Warner Bros. Television is part of the Warner Bros unit of Time Warner Inc.Throughout much of 2010, the actor was involved in a series of drug and alcohol-related incidents, and in August pleaded guilty to an assault on his now ex-wife.But he signed up for two more seasons in May 2010, and got a pay raise that brought his salary to a reported $27.5 million a year for his role as hard-drinking womanizing bachelor Charlie Harper, which in many ways has mirrored his real life.Sheen appeared to be tempting fate when he told the syndicated Alex Jones Show on the radio on Thursday that ""I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show.""He also made a dig at his producer's Jewish background, calling him ""Chaim Levine."" Lorre was born Charles Michael Levine. He could not be reached for comment.In remarks later to TMZ.com, Sheen was quoted as saying of Lorre, ""I violently hate Chaim Levine. He's a stupid, stupid little man ... that I'd never want to be like.""Audiences for Two and a Half Men have remained strong despite Sheen's well-publicized rabble rousing. The show attracts about 15 million US viewers a week.",https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-cbs-axes-two-and-a-half-men-after-charlie-sheen-insults-1512600
Is sex on your mind all the time?,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2011-04-10T00:00:00,"It’s the fantasy, isn’t it? To be able to do it whenever, with whoever, and however many times we want. It’s much cooler to say ‘I’m addicted to sex’, than admit to being dependent on, say, alcohol or drugs. Why else would celebs brag about the numbers of partners they’ve had?Actors Charlie Sheen and Jack Nicholson are believed to have done it with over 5,000 and 2,000 women respectively. And British comedian Russell Brand claimed he had “a harem of about 10 women, whom I would rotate in addition to casual encounters and one-night-stands.”All these celebrities may come across as simply promiscuous, but there’s a more hip term to describe their behaviour: sex addiction. In a global culture presided over by a sex-saturated media, it’s glamorous to be ‘addicted to sex’, even if not all experts agree that there is such a thing as a ‘sex addiction’.It’s not just celebrities who have too much sex with multiple partners to help them ‘relax’. Ordinary people feel the same “clinical need” too. The Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders (DSM), a reference guide for mental health professionals the world over, claims that “these men and women are presenting themselves to clinicians because of recurrent, ‘out of control’ sexual behaviours”.This is not technically an ‘addiction’ but a “dependence on sex which impairs social functioning”. While it isn’t a clinical condition yet, by 2013, when the DSM-V is released, ‘hypersexual disorder’ will be a recognised sexual dysfunction.Yes, if you’re having too much sex, it could mean you have a mental problem, according to the DSM-V. Experts say that just because we label it doesn’t mean its ‘brand new’.“It’s not as if premenstrual syndrome didn’t exist 1,000 years back. It’s just that now there’s a label to it,” says psychiatrist Shefali Batra of MindFrames counselling centre. But the DSM finding a clinical name for ‘hypersexual disorder’ will help improve awareness about the problem, say experts.Are we over-medicalising sex?There’s another camp of clinicians that believes hypersexual disorder is nothing more than an excuse to legitimately run a ‘sex clinic’, or ‘treat’ people for their overactive sex drives. Experts argue that we’re ‘over-medicalising’ any behaviour that deviates from the norm. Why is too much sex being branded a ‘dysfunction’?“The terminology defined by the DSM will propagate myths within the medical community and with patients. Take the term ‘premature ejaculation’ — what is a ‘mature’ ejaculation? Who defines the benchmarks? Who gets to say what’s normal?” asks sexologist Prakash Kothari, also an advisor to the World Association for Sexual Health.Then there’s the argument that while we may be having more sex than our ancestors, what’s really changed is that we’re talking about it much more, and there’s easier access to all things sex. Thanks to the internet, a whole generation of youngsters now has easy access to porn. All kinds of porn: doing it with strangers, siblings, werewolves, hookers, gay people, even ghosts and aliens.Arun*, a 29-year-old engineer, says he was addicted to porn. He started his day with half an hour, sometimes more, of watching porn online. He had a collection of porn that spanned different types and themes or sexual acts, various positions, and in different languages. His routine often made him late for work but he just couldn’t stop. Besides his daily onanisms, he had sex with his girlfriend once or twice a week. After they were finished, he didn’t feel satisfied unless he logged on to the internet and let himself go again.So when is it a disorder?But what exactly is hypersexual disorder (HD)? According to the DSM-V, HD can be diagnosed if someone has “recurrent and intense sexual fantasies, urges and compulsive behaviour for a period of at least six months, and this causes significant personal distress and affects one’s social functioning.”This also includes excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography addiction, frequent sex, phone sex, and visits to strip clubs. Experts in Mumbai agree that it’s a growing problem that needs to be discussed.No one’s really sure what causes hypersexuality. Another psychological condition, bipolar disorder (BD), also manifests itself in the form of heightened sexual urges. One study reported that 82% of sex addicts were sexually abused as children. But sometimes, just an emotionally disturbing situation could be a trigger.Take Mitesh*, 26, for instance. After his girlfriend of three years dumped him, he couldn’t stop thinking about sex. He was masturbating every few hours at work, and after office hours, he’d go looking for action even if it meant having to pay for it. He started looking at every woman, literally, as a ‘sex object’. The only friend he had was Neha*, a colleague at the chartered accounting firm he worked. Initially, she was his shoulder to cry on, but soon they became ‘friends with benefits’.But she couldn’t cope with his demand for sex three or four times a day during office hours, followed by a night of more sex. Unable to keep up, Neha eventually had to seek help. The sexologist she consulted spent weeks talking to Mitesh and found out that the ‘sweet, shy boy’ who once had trouble initiating a kiss with his girlfriend had become this sex-starved Casanova-like person after she dumped him. He’d loved and respected her, and when that didn’t work out, he decided not to take women seriously at all. Months of counselling later, Mitesh realised he was abusing sex and ill-treating his best friend Neha. The two are now preparing for their wedding later this year.Like in Mitesh’s case, it’s usually the partner who approaches the expert. “In my practice, more women come to me than men because they can’t cope with their partner’s sexual demands,” says sexologist Deepak Jumani. However, he adds, there are women who suffer from a heightened sex drive too. “But most women I’ve seen with hypersexuality are initially forced to have sex with husbands or lovers but find that they enjoy it and look for gratification from other males too,” he says.How much is too much?Experts are reluctant to quantify and define what a ‘normal’ sexual appetite really is. “There’s no ‘normal’ limit for sex. On a honeymoon, eight times a day could be normal for a couple, whereas after the holiday, eight times a week may be too much,” says Batra. “No two partners have the same desire. What’s ‘comfortable’ for both will be considered normal,” she adds.The DSM disagrees. It has quantified what ‘normal is’. Once diagnosed, HD can be classified in terms of severity. Mild HD is when the person spends 15-30 minutes fantasising about sex on an average day and indulges in hypersexual activity once in an average week. Severe hypersexuality is when the person spends more than 2 hours a day preoccupied with sex and displays hypersexual behaviour (masturbation and/or partner-related) six or more times in an average week.This idea of ‘normal’ is what will confuse people, say some experts. That’s probably why, even though the DSM is reluctant to label it, hypersexual disorder is otherwise known as sex addiction. Like with alcohol-, gambling- or drug-addictions, sex addicts know they need help when it starts interfering with their everyday lives.Take the case of Akshay*, a 39-year-old account manager at an ad firm. After a promotion in 2007, he found that his stress levels had increased. He was spending more time at work and reaching home long after his wife and 8-year-old son were asleep. It started with an affair at work that lasted all of one week. After that, he needed to ‘relieve’ himself at least one a day during the workday, before going home, waking up his wife and doing it again. Pretty soon he was going out during office hours to cheap hotels with women he didn’t know.Sex as a de-stressorHis wife tried to talk him into seeing a therapist, but he refused. Even after they separated, he couldn’t bring himself to stop. But when women at his workplace started complaining about how he propositioned them, management took things more seriously. He was asked to go. That was the breaking point. He met a counsellor and apologised to his wife. A year later, the two are still separated. Akshay managed to get a job at another ad firm and still has the odd sexual encounter with a stranger, but he isn’t as compulsive about it anymore. Therapy, he says, helped him deal with stress.During sex, higher serotonin levels in the brain give a natural ‘high’. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps uplift one’s mood. “That’s why, even though depression causes a low sex drive, people suffering from it have sex to elevate their moods,” says Batra. The downside of this is that random acts of sex with strangers are known to cause low self-esteem.Sex addiction clinics in the West follow a 12-step de-addiction programme, like rehabs for alcohol and drug abuse. A forum called ‘Sexaholics Anonymous’ works on the lines of an AA (alcoholics anonymous) programme — with members working like a support group for fellow-addicts. In India, a treatment plan includes lots of counselling, psychotherapy, and drugs, as a last resort.While psychologists don’t agree that a heightened sex drive should be classified as a problem, patients feel they need help — whether or not it’s an excuse for promiscuity and infidelity. That’s one of the reasons the DSM is including hypersexual disorder as a mental condition.The DSM is, after all, a reflection of society’s needs. Interestingly, what the DSM proposes to remove from the manual is ‘sexual aversion disorder’ — currently defined as a persistent psychological aversion to genital sexual contact with a partner. This doesn’t mean that we’re having more sex with different partners — on the net and in real time — and that no one’s averse to sex anymore… or does it?Names of patients have been changed on request",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-is-sex-on-your-mind-all-the-time-1530150
This is one ecstasy that Dombivlikars want to curb,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2009-07-17T19:26:00,"Over the last few years the slow elevation of Dombivli’s urban status, from being a non-descript suburb to a fast paced high living neighbourhood, has not been without the hassles that a big city faces.While the crime rate has been more or less stable over the last one decade, there has been a shift in the kind of crimes and a large number of residents are waking up to the reality that a big city comes with its own set of woes.For instance consider drug peddling. Five years ago, drug peddlers routinely rounded up by the police comprised people from the lower strata selling cheap smack.The substances which mostly abused by daily wage workers and auto drivers did not have the kind of demand that requires a swift and timely intervention by the police.Today, it’s no longer smack. “It’s true that in the last one year we have seen a rise in the consumption of substances like cocaine, heroin and marijuana along with party drugs,” said a senior police official in the Mumbai police headquarters. He added, “However to say that there are big cartels operating in the twin cities will be stretching it a bit.”The rising in-your-face nature of the problem is leading citizens in the twin cities, especially the one’s who have moved here from Mumbai or other suburbs, to talk openly about the problem, voice their concerns and maybe help the police, the social welfare department and other stakeholders weed the problem out. “Earlier one would think of a drug addict as a criminal. Today there are children drinking alcohol and abusing substances.” said 52-year-old Mahesh Navate, a resident of Kalyan who left his job as a school teacher in Mumbai to start his own private tuition business. He added, “The problem is now changing. In the sense that the addict doesn’t need the police but help and the police needs to not go after addicts but after the peddlers who are known to hoodwink the system.”One important chunk of the kind of addicts Mahesh Navate is talking about are the students of the various high grade schools that have earned the twin cities the reputation of a education hotspot. “Being around students makes me keenly aware of what the issues are and how the various stakeholders are passing the buck,” he said.The problems Navate is talking about the are quite similar to the one’s being tackled by schools all over the country - rising substance abuse among school children.According to a senior police official posted in Kalyan, the city is in the throes of a rising drug problem, which is openly compounded by the entry of drug cartels. “A drug cartel is more organised and their presence in a city is a clear indication of who is having problems with substance abuse. The situation is no different in Kalyan. School children, college going youngsters and young business executives are fast falling prey to drug abuse lifestyle,” the senior police officer added.As DNA approached the local police with similar queries on drug abuse patterns, the lack of awareness of the officials was appalling if not plain ludicrous. But as residents and social workers opened up, it was soon clear that the lack of awareness of the lower rung of the police machinery is in fact a farce, perpetuated to camouflage the rampant involvement of the police in the diabolical enterprise.“The problem is the involvement of the police at the lower level in all these nefarious activities. There have been many instances where the residents gave complaints to the cops about the drug peddlers in the neighbourhood,” said Jyoti Varde, a 26-year-old social worker who lives in Dombivli and works in Mumbai helping rehabilitate people with a history of drug abuse and associated problems.She told DNA that the twin cities were rife with all the symptoms that a city infested with a drug cartel displayed. “I went to a party recently thrown by a young business executive to celebrate his new three bedroom house. After a point a few guests openly consumed marijuana and by the time the party was peaking phone calls to coke peddlers had been made. The peddler was a young man his 20s who supplied the substance out in the parking lot of the building to the guest who had summoned him. What struck me was that this could have been a party in Cuffe Parade, or Golf Links in Delhi or any other major city in the world,” she said.While the twin cities have a number of NGOs working with addiction issues and also has an active chapter of the alcoholics anonymous, there is no movement or initiative that deals with substance abuse problems of the new rich - the people who make Dombivli cosmopolitan.“It is important to understand that the addict has a problem. It may have its roots in any number if social factors but the addict himself is not the problem. This kind of a mindset is currently missing,” she added.",https://www.dnaindia.com/special-features/special-this-is-one-ecstasy-that-dombivlikars-want-to-curb-1274943
"I've already died twice, says Paul 'Gazza' Gascoigne",[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1518768.jpg,2011-03-11T19:40:54,"Former England football star Paul Gascoigne has candidly revealed that he has come back from the dead twice while trying to overcome his addiction to alcohol and drugs.Gazza now looks gaunt and has a hairline that is thinning at age 43, but is regaining his physical and emotional health, and is sober to boot.""The country cares for me, I know that. And, I take everything on board people say. But now I have to do everything for myself. And now I am more at peace with everything and enjoying myself,"" the Daily Express quoted him, as saying.He admits that even by his own madcap standards, 2010 was manic.He insists that he spent the first half of 2010 hardly drinking. He says that his tolerance for alcohol of the old days, when he could drink bottles of wine or spirits in a session, is now gone. Instead, he was a recluse, just leaving his flat in the Newcastle suburb of Jesmond.Then, one Sunday last June, he decided to go to a pub to watch a World Cup game. He was harassed and called a friend to drive him home. The car arrived with the friend's girlfriend driving. Minutes later, it ploughed into a lamppost and bollards at high speed in the city's Quayside district.""I woke up the next day with a broken nose, a cut over my eye, a cut on my arms, broken ribs and a punctured lung, "" he says.""They told me I died in the ambulance twice. My dad and my sister were standing next to the bed and she took a photo that shocked me.""""I went home 12 days later and didn't have my house keys so I got up on a ladder to get into the house, fell off and did another rib. I went back to the hospital and they put me on an oxygen machine to pump up the lung again. I accidentally switched it off and was turning blue.""Now, the drinking took off again, the amounts small but the dependence still the same.""Four cans was enough for a couple of weeks, because I hadn't been drinking for a while, but then it became six. I could drink a bottle of whisky but give me six cans and I will be drunk. It was getting too much for me.""When his situation seemed to be getting out of control, Gazza called Steve Spiegel, the founder of the Providence Project centre in Bournemouth, who had offered Gascoigne help before.Gazza lasted five weeks before heading back home, spooked by a newspaper report that people were buying him cans in treatment, which he denies.He came back for another 11 days before returning to Newcastle again.One night he drank a quarter bottle of gin. The next afternoon, he was in Jesmond at a cash point when a woman - after getting a photo of him with her two sons - reported him to the police as being unsteady, having just got out of his MG sports car.Police arrested him in the car, 142mg of alcohol still in his system against the limit of 35mg.At a court appearance, the judge told him he could expect to go to jail. The next day he collapsed.Police arrested him on suspicion of possessing cocaine. ""I never was a drug taker, "" he insists.He says: ""I have slipped up with cocaine a few times, I know that, when people have offered me a line in a pub toilet, but I have had to take some of the stories about me because I have done it before.""Now Gazza knew he had to give Providence a proper try and again rang Spiegel, who drove to Newcastle to collect him. This time, Gascoigne lasted the course.The judge in the drink driving case accepted that treatment was more beneficial than a prison cell and imposed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, plus a three-year ban.What kept him going through the demanding daily regime of group sessions, workshops, one to-one counselling and evening Alcoholics Anonymous meetings was the thought of making it to a passing-out ritual and receiving a commemorative coin in front of his peers in treatment.Now in aftercare, he continues to deal with his demons, not least the ruins of his relationship with ex-wife Sheryl, son Regan and stepchildren Mason and Bianca.A documentary about them last year laid bare the pain all round.""I would like one day to see the kids. I don't like it when they go to the papers and say, 'I don't want to see my dad', but I understand why they might say it. I can't let it ruin my sobriety. I'm not being selfish. I would just rather the kids see me when I'm better,” he says.",https://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-i-ve-already-died-twice-says-paul-gazza-gascoigne-1518767

Addicted to the Internet? Here are ways you can quit,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1851202.jpg,2013-06-21T22:23:29,"From hardcover books to fan fiction; from sending letters to e-mailing; from making entries in personal journals to blogging; and from making friends the conventional way to visiting chat rooms.With the world having seen this shift, one can only expect people to develop an obsession with the Internet. And considering how common this obsession is nowadays, medical experts have termed it Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD).So what exactly is IAD?Words like alcoholic and insomnia are often used callously without taking into consideration the seriousness of the conditions. The same might be applied to those suffering from IAD.According to addictionrecov.org, symptoms of this disorder range from preoccupation with thoughts about the Internet to using it for increasing amounts of time to losing the ability to interact with people face to face, repeatedly attempting to cut down on the time spent on the Internet, but being unsuccessful and jeopardising relationships by lying about it, etc.A more obvious symptom would be obsessive 'tweeting' or a compulsively updating status messages.Physical symptoms could be developing carpal tunnel syndrome, dry and strained eyes, aches in your back and neck, headaches, disturbances in your sleep cycle and alarming weight loss or weight gain.Although it does not involve the use of intoxicating substances, IAD is similar to pathological gambling. Those suffering from the disorder live in their virtual world, often creating a different identity that they get addicted to. These people who lead alternate lives online are the ones at highest risk of suffering from negative feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, which could, in turn, lead to depression.So if you experience any of the above, know that you have a problem; one that you require help for if you want to rid yourself of it.Helpguide.org categorises Internet addiction into the following:Cybersex addiction : An obsessive, compulsive use of Internet pornography: An obsessive, compulsive use of Internet pornography Cyber-relationship addiction : An addiction to social networking and giving online friends more importance than real-life relationships: An addiction to social networking and giving online friends more importance than real-life relationships Net compulsions: Compulsive online gaming, gambling, stock trading, etc.Compulsive online gaming, gambling, stock trading, etc. Information overload: Compulsive web surfing or database searchingCompulsive web surfing or database searching Computer addiction: Obsessive playing of off-line computer games like Solitaire or MinesweeperOf these different kinds of Internet addictions, seeking help for cybersex addiction, especially in a county like India where sex is a taboo, could be the most challenging.Like with any other addiction, admitting that you indeed suffer from IAD would be the first step, not to mention the hardest. Accepting that you have problem takes a lot of courage, but could take you a long way on the road to recovery.Help yourselfFor those interested in self-help, wikihow enlists a few ways of getting rid of the Internet fixation.- Beginning with determining how much time you spend online, it says finding activities that could substitute spending time online, like reading, taking a walk and finding a different hobby, could be of great help.- Next, taking it one day at a time, you could try cutting down on the time spent online, even keeping a timer if really necessary.- Other steps that could help are ensuring that you subscribe to a limited Internet plan, not winding down your day on the Internet, going online only with a specific purpose in mind, etc.Spending time with real people and building yourself a support system could be of immense help. Apart from helping you develop the ability to interact again, having more relations could negate your psychological need for the Internet and online friends.Some interesting methods are using your non-dominant hand to perform tasks like moving the mouse or scrolling, typing with just one hand, placing obstacles that disrupt your regular routine, etc.If these 'survival strategies' do not help, seeking professional help or joining a support group would be good options. Since this is a relatively new form of addiction, finding support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous could be difficult. As ironic as this may be, there are higher chances of finding them online.Therapy or counselling could help talk you out of your current perceptions about the Internet or any underlying issues, and provide you with step-by-step methods to rid you of the addiction.Now moving to helping the addictsIf you do know someone who exhibits symptoms of IAD, but either has not realised it or simply refuses to admit it, your support could be of great help. Introducing that person to other activities to divert their mind, making an example of yourself by managing your own Internet usage and, in extreme cases, encouraging them to seek professional help are a few ways you could help.These, along with the required willpower and conviction, could determine how successful one's attempt at de-addiction would be.",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-addicted-to-the-internet-here-are-ways-you-can-quit-1851196
Deportation looms for John McAfee after heart attack drama,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1774516.jpg,2012-12-07T08:06:57,"Software guru John McAfee, fighting deportation to Belize, was rushed to a hospital in Guatemala on Thursday shortly after his asylum request was rejected, but a suspected heart attack turned out to be stress in a fresh twist to the saga.The 67-year-old US computer software pioneer was taken swiftly from a hospital in a police car out of the sight of media, after earlier arriving in an ambulance lying on a stretcher. His lawyer said he was being taken back to an immigration department cottage where he has been detained since crossing illegally into Guatemala from neighboring Belize, where police want to question him in connection with his neighbor's murder.""He never had a heart attack, nothing like that,"" said Telesforo Guerra, a former attorney general who had earlier said McAfee had two mild heart attacks. ""I'm not a doctor. I'm just telling you what the doctors told me,"" he added. ""He was suffering from stress, hypertension and tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat)."" McAfee was posting on his blog www.whoismcafee.com in the morning, the time he suffered the stress attack.""I don't think a heart attack prevents one from using one's blog,"" Guerra had said at the time. Guerra's assistant, Karla Paz, earlier said she found McAfee lying on the ground and unable to move his body or speak. McAfee was detained by Guatemalan police on Wednesday for illegally sneaking across the border with his 20-year-old girlfriend to escape authorities in Belize.He has said he fears authorities in Belize will kill him if he returns. Guatemala's foreign minister, Harold Caballeros, said earlier McAfee's request for asylum was rejected. Constitutional lawyer Gabriel Orellana, a former foreign minister, said the government should have given more weight to the asylum request rather than rush to a decision. ""We should take into account the fact that McAfee has not been accused of any crime in Belize,"" he said.Quarrelled With Fellow AmericanPolice in Belize want to quiz McAfee as ""a person of interest"" in the killing of a fellow American, Gregory Faull, with whom he had quarreled. But they say he is not a prime suspect in the probe. McAfee says he has been persecuted by Belize's ruling party because he refused to pay around $2 million he says it is trying to hustle out of him, he said. Belize's prime minister denies this and said McAfee, who made millions from the Internet anti-virus software that bears his name, was ""bonkers.""McAfee later lost much of his fortune and turned to a life of semi-reclusion by the Belizean beach. McAfee spent Wednesday night reading his blog and posting his thoughts on a laptop he said was lent to him by the warden of the cottage where he was staying. One person asked him if he felt like committing suicide. ""I enjoy living, and suicide is absurdly redundant,"" he wrote.""The world, from the very beginning, hurls viruses, accidents, hungry animals, defective DNA - and uncountable more - in an attempt to kill us. It always succeeds. Suicide is simply aiding and abetting."" McAfee's earlier posts spoke of his relief at arriving in Guatemala, thinking he had found a way out of his troubles. One of his readers posted a message offering him just that.""John. I have a special ops team near the La Aurora International Airport. I can get you out of jail and provide safe passage back to the States for a fee. Please let me know if this interests you.""Drug PastGuatemala's government originally said the eccentric tech entrepreneur, who loves guns and young women and has tribal tattoos covering his shoulders, would be expelled to Belize within hours. But it later rowed back. The US state department said it was aware of McAfee's arrest and its embassy was providing ""appropriate consular services,"" but could not comment further. On the island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived for about four years, residents and neighbors say he is eccentric and at times unstable.He was seen to travel with armed bodyguards, sporting a pistol tucked into his belt. The predicament of the former Lockheed systems consultant is a far cry from his heyday in the late 1980s, when he started McAfee Associates. McAfee has no relationship now with the company, which was sold to Intel Corp. McAfee was previously charged in Belize with possession of illegal firearms, and police had raided his property on suspicions that he was running a lab to produce illegal synthetic narcotics. He says he has not taken drugs since 1983.""I took drugs constantly, 24 hours of the day. I took them for years and years. I was the worst drug abuser on the planet,"" he told Reuters just before his arrest. ""Then I finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, and that was the end of it.""",https://www.dnaindia.com/technology/report-deportation-looms-for-john-mcafee-after-heart-attack-drama-1774509

How the power of prayer has helped so many,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1816443.jpg,2013-03-28T09:53:08,"Ten years ago, I begged God to help me do what I could not alone. Like millions of other smokers, I had struggled for years to quit and failed every time. Although a cradle Catholic, my prayers were rusty and I had only recently started going to church again. Yet a strong and loving voice that I was certain belonged to God suddenly said, clear as a bell: ""I will make this easy for you.""I felt calm and free. I have not smoked since, nor wanted to. Unfortunately, the voice also said: ""But you have to tell people how I helped you.""Now, surely, came the hard part. I wasn't good or devout, I was a doubting Thomas and worked in the cynical media. I was certain that if I told people God had spoken to me, they'd think me vain, mad or a ""God Botherer"".It turns out, though, that I needn't have worried. When I wrote a piece about my experience for The Daily Telegraph at the start of the year, it generated a substantial and supportive postbag. Now I know why. According to new research commissioned by the Church of England, a staggering six people in seven believe in the power of prayer - despite the dramatic drop in formal religious observance.My experience bears out these findings. Scores of readers wrote, privately describing similar miraculous releases from addiction or illness following prayer or meditation. Most were Christian, but others were agnostic, Buddhist or had simply prayed to their ""angels"" or ""Higher Power"".Many experienced complete, instant freedom, like solicitor James M: ""I had, from my teenage years, been a heavy smoker, reaching 60 per day. One Christmas Eve, I and a friend, now my wife, were received into the Roman Catholic Church. Within days, I woke up with the sense that I did not have to smoke any more. I suffered no withdrawal symptoms. The odd thing is that I had no wish or intention to give up. It just happened.""Talking about miracles is very un-British: you could spend decades attending mainstream churches and not hear a single person acknowledge God's help in defeating some sort of heinous addiction.Valerie from Somerset described long battles with over-eating. Five months ago, she prayed ""to God to stop being tempted. On waking the very next morning, temptation was removed from me. It really was as simple as that. Christmas slipped past with all its richer foods and, yes, still there was no temptation to snack. Thank God. And I mean that in the best possible way.""Two people wrote of apparently miraculous recoveries from cancer. Neither had conventional faith. Peter H wrote: ""A growth on my thyroid 16 years ago was diagnosed (from a biopsy) as a malignant cancer, but when operated on it appeared miraculously to be benign. I'm somewhat agnostic but I went through a deep process with God before the operation, and afterwards I wanted to tell all about God's love and power with genuine conviction.""Ellen J wrote: ""I know what you mean by living in a secular society in which 'believing in the Higher Power' is often met with ridicule. I myself am not a religious person at all but my siblings are."" They prayed for her recovery from a second operation on a breast tumour, and ""the oncologist who saw me afterwards said he had never seen a patient healed so quickly"".A former army major described how his 40-a-day smoking habit escalated to ""a 100-a-day-with-the-filters-ripped-off-habit"" when he was in Bosnia during the siege of Sarajevo. Milos Stankovic MBE - described by former MP Martin Bell as a hero - gave up by using willpower alone, but it took a year of gritted teeth determination. ""But I much prefer your approach. From your description, I have no doubt that you had divine help.""The ex-paratrooper ran Schindler's List-type secret escape lines for endangered families in Bosnia and helped found the Braveheart military charity for traumatised veterans. He is now a consultant and trainer in a shamanic-influenced method called Neural Pathways Restructuring, which claims a high success rate among clients suffering from combat-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and addictions - including smoking and heroin. ""All my clients' successes have occurred when they suspended their disbelief,"" Stankovic says. ""And all the failures occurred when their egos and conscious thought-processes allowed doubt and scepticism.""The Bible describes many miracles, and sceptics believe it attunes Christians to divine help. One of my online critics felt sure I had subconsciously manufactured the voice through my deep need and my Catholic background. I can understand why a sceptic would think that. But I remain grateful for what happened.Colette was a long-lapsed Catholic and struggling with infertility and repeated miscarriages when her GP confided in her that he, too, was a Christian and felt that prayer would help guide her. ""It never occurred to me to include God in this journey,"" she told me. She wrote of a set of ""coincidences"" that led her and her husband to adopt a child, whose genuine birth name was, she believes, revealed to her in prayer.""Like you, I am an educated woman and not prone to flights of fancy but I know the Holy Spirit guided me and spoke to me clearly throughout the whole process. All I can say is that where prayer is involved, there are many coincidences.""If prayer is a placebo, as many in our secular world believe, it is an extraordinarily powerful one, and ""small miracles"" are more common than we realise.A hospital consultant friend of mine, a non-believer, is currently reading The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, Britain's leading aetheist. He mentioned Dawkins's claim that only 17 Lourdes miracles have been indisputably confirmed (which is, none the less, 17 deeply blessed people). More worryingly, he says, his hospital sees ""at least six cancer patients a year"" who die unnecessarily because they have refused conventional treatments and instead relied solely on ""wacky faith cures"".But I believe God helps those who help themselves. I didn't just pray when I wanted to give up smoking as I explained in my article; I also joined an NHS quit-smoking group and walked and swam for miles to release my feel-good endorphins in a healthier way. I experienced occasional pangs, but this time I knew I would make it: the support of that loving voice stayed with me throughout.It is already known that prayer and meditation have considerable beneficial effects, physically as well as psychologically. They calm the mind, slow the heartbeat, abate fear, diminish the pumping of stress hormones and boost the immune system. If this is ""mind over matter"", it is certainly powerful. It could be self-generated, as sceptics think, but what if the process is itself divine?A mother wrote to me of a relative's recovery from drug addiction thanks to Cenacoloro, a non-denominational international recovery community founded 30 years ago by an Italian Catholic nun, which claims a high success rate. ""Young people from all religious backgrounds and none, but suffering from drug and alcohol addiction, enter the community and learn through hard work, prayer and a structured daily routine to rebuild their lives. They all say it is the prayer that works,"" she says.Several readers had used the Twelve Steps method of Alcoholics Anonymous, now widely applied to other forms of addiction, to give up various vices. AA was founded by Christians but merely advocates appealing to a Higher Power, so that people of all faiths can benefit from its key teaching, namely that we only recover from addiction when we admit our powerlessness and need for ""the God of our understanding"" to help free us. We need to hit rock bottom and surrender.Gina, who wrote to me, follows AA's programme. ""A belief in a Power greater than myself and acceptance (that took a long time) of my powerlessness over all my addictions has made it possible to remain sober and, amazingly, also to stop smoking. I think I had tried everything before, short of marooning myself on a desert island. And that wouldn't have lasted. I would have headed straight for the nearest shop the moment the rescue plane touched down.""It was quite sudden and relatively painless. I have had pangs, but they pass. I am also learning to meditate, which helps. Quite simply I believe I had help from a Higher Power. And for that I am very grateful.""It may seem odd in these cynical times to be endorsing the power of prayer. I can only relate what readers told me. I am working on a book about the power of prayer and the spirit, and would be delighted to hear from people of other faiths and agnostics, too. Asking God for release from addiction may seem superstitious baloney to non-believers. But, God knows why, it seems to work.",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-how-the-power-of-prayer-has-helped-so-many-1816441
My life on your timeline: Online activism or validation?,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/02/699490-timeline1.jpg,2018-07-02T00:00:00,"Social media is a double-edged sword. It was the powerful weapon used during the #MeToo movement against sexual crimes. Social media was also responsible for the mighty Arab Spring. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were also the mediums through which 'Not In My Name' found people from across India standing up against the government being silent on lynchings and killings. These select instances only go to show the power of this tool.Ankit Lal, author of India Social, which talks about social media being viewed as a political pawn, attributes the start of this online catharsis in India to the #StopAcidAttacks movement started by acid attack survivor Lakshmi in 2013. It made people not only condemn the attacks online, but also share personal stories after their own experiences of being stalked or harassed through a series of posts. ""Then Nirbhaya happened, and we all spoke about getting rid of rape.""But the same medium is also used for a plethora of baffling activities. There are forms of attention-seeking behaviours that try to pass off as 'activism', but makes one go, 'what the heck!' For instance, *Ramya Ashraf's profile on Instagram is a patchwork of posts on body positivity gathered from several women. Another Instagram celebrity in the same niche uploads photos of arms raised to expose long, unflattering underarm hair, in some cases even dyed and styled to show that she is proud of not shaving. Be as it may, the question people are asking is why inflict these pictures on the global viewers on the Internet.Where once there was journaling about one's state of mind, today's generation increasingly wants to clock every emotion online – be it mood swings or grief.*Janice lost her mother three years ago. Although grief can never be scorned, all of her Instagram posts are pictures of herself with her mom, family nostalgia, objects her mother used, which reduces the healing process of grieving, leaving followers flummoxed.Does talking about your constant state of mind, a bad hair day, pimples on your face, acne on your back, help one get better or reach acceptance faster than a shoulder to cry on? What makes one put themself in a vulnerable position to strangers? Do the likes and comments of sympathy and solidarity in response to their posts give them some sort of validation?Give me all your attention""People who put up such bizarre content online may be trying to convey a certain point, but the main goal behind it all is validation,"" explains consulting psychologist Kinjal Pandya. ""It has little to do with whether they are getting positive feedback online or not, and more to do with eliciting some sort of reaction online. It is just their way of saying 'Look at me!""One such strange, if ambitious, photo project was taken up by *Sunny Goldman, who takes photos of her lovers to capture their various moods. The resultant photos are black-and-white, out-of-focus, over-exposed and/or blurred, have stark naked men either posing, sitting away or staring back listlessly, or crouching towards her, and appear as if the viewer took them when high. While the images themselves have been tagged voyeuristic, uploading them online makes the voyeurism twofold, as it is now open for all to see. Fashion photographer Atul Kasbekar, whose own shoots are structured and devoid of this element of the tease, says that such experimentation is often an indication of a lack of talent. ""You want to stand out however you can. Often the results become more ridiculous than artistic,"" he explains.Kasbekar warns of another, more dangerous trend that requires one to protect one's online presence. ""The recent spate of videos where faces are morphed onto sex tapes that are making their way around the web goes to show you how far voyeurism has gone,"" he sighs. ""It's more than just about pouty selfies and strange pictures. A need for safety is the call of the hour.""He points towards small-time celebrities, and one-time-famous actors and actresses as typical examples of people who will post anything to stay in public eye online, so long as some of the focus falls their way. ""We all know a certain celebrity, who has been using strange Snapchat filters to shoot videos of inane events in her life [all told with a pout of course],"" he hints. ""A genuinely talented individual can let his work speak.""The myth of the hunter Narcissus falling in love with his own reflection, losing his will to live, passing away and turning into a beautiful flower may date all the way back to ancient Greece, but narcissism now continues to live through social media. ""You open yourself up to the possibility of cyber bullying; not everything you put up with the best intentions will be received as such,"" says Pandya, who adds that negative attention of this nature may have a spiraling effect, leading to depression and self-esteem issues, especially in young adults. When flabby arm and freckles are highlighted as body issues and portrayed as such, they bring attention to attributes of the body that may have otherwise been simply ignored.An example of following ridiculous fashion fads for no other reason than their popularity would be that of a growing tribe of Kim Kardashian wannabes: eyebrows made thick, arched with not a single hair astray, pouty lips poker straight long hair with middle parting and a ravine of cleavage exposed. Moreover, these unsmiling faces with come-hither lips as selfies are given captions that make no sense. One example is Sandra*, who in her Instagram bio claims her fat lips are real and that the rest of us need to pay a cosmetic surgeon to get what she's been naturally gifted. Yet in the few pictures she's forgotten to Photoshop, her lips are nowhere close to the bloated fish lips smacked with red or nude lipstick.Where do the lonely hearts go?Sociologist and columnist, Shiv Vishvanathan likens this regurgitation of matter online to a confessional at the church. Just as one finds solace in the act of speaking one's heart out to a priest, with a certain sense of anonymity, one uses social media as a way to 'confess' to their faceless followers. ""People look online for comfort as they are desperate for someone to listen to them. But with everyone speaking, I am doubtful how much listening actually happens,"" he says. For those like Janice, Vishvanathan says that online consolation can only take one so far. ""Healing from any kind of loss is a process, one that has as many stages as a novel written by Dostoevsky,"" he says, adding, ""If social media could completely heal a person, then that would be revolutionary – changing the language of the Internet – but that has not happened yet.""The feeling of community and solidarity found online can be compared to alcoholics finding solutions in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, feels Dr Rizwana Nulwala, psychotherapist and founder of Krizalyz, a counselling and mental health service. ""Every time somebody validates your post with a like or comment, it triggers the same reward mechanism or 'high/kick' in the brain that you get on consuming alcohol or drugs. So every time you feel low, you deal with it by just posting a picture to feel better,"" she says, viewing this as a direct result of alienation.She observes how many below the age of 35 years in India are increasingly leading a hyper-individualistic lifestyle like the West, with hopeless dependence on the Internet and the phone, which have replaced their interaction with real world. Many move to work in another city, and may not have the luxury to make friends outside work. Despite feeling isolated, the virtual world to them feels less threatening. ""Online, you can just cut off someone you don't like, delete comments or choose not to respond, and unfriend or unfollow. In the real world, you need social skills for a one-on-one conflict resolution,"" says Nulwala. This, she adds, is why introverts, especially, prefer to vent on online forums and block themselves from offline interactions as these require diplomatic and social skills.One can endlessly debate the pros and cons of the serious and the frivolous that's being posted online, whether it takes away from the original reason that social media was created, or whether one should democratically accept the good with the froth. But as Kinjal Pandya suggests, the option of unfollowing or switching off, ultimately lies with you.*Names changed",https://www.dnaindia.com/just-before-monday/report-my-life-on-your-timeline-2631485

I was not talking about the LGBT (youths) but about drug addicted and sexually abused youths,"" Tawadkar told PTI, as local channels in Goa continued to air the footage in which he assured medical treatment to LGBT youths to make them ""normal"".""Youth policy speaks about drug addicted youths and sexually abused youths as a focused group. There are provisions in the central government sponsored Social Justice Scheme for such youths which can be implemented in Goa,"" the Sports and Youth Affairs minister said, a day after he was widely criticised for his statements.He said when journalists asked him about LGBTs(Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders), he told them, ""I am not expert on the issue.""The minister also refused to acknowledge LGBT as a focused group, though the youth policy document which is currently in public domain has mentioned them as one.""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres.We will train them and give them medicines too,"" the minister had said.""Like in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" he had added.In a damage control exercise, Parsekar said, ""Homosexuality is a natural thing, it is not a disease. It could be ignorance. Probably, he might have thought of some other question and reacted.""Asked what was the state government's stand on homosexuality, he said, ""it is a natural thing"".The row broke out even as visiting UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon strongly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality in India, saying that doing so breeds intolerance by violating basic rights to privacy and freedom.Reacting to Tawadkar's remarks, noted fashion designer Wendell Rodricks said the minister was trying to divert attention from the main issues by talking such things.""There are lot of other issues which need urgent attention in Goa.

Education superstars: How the Akanksha Foundation is an agent of hope for students,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2015/09/19/377456-akanksha-foundation1.jpg,2015-09-19T00:00:00,"When I said goodbye to loved ones and made my way from Canada's Ottawa International Airport to India, I was nervous and felt completely unprepared for my Mumbai assignment with the Akanksha Foundation. After almost two days in transit, I arrived in Mumbai and wondered if a taxi driver would be waiting, holding up a white cardboard sign with my name on it, as had been promised. I was relieved to see that he was, which brought my stress levels down, and it never shot up for the rest of my trip.The assignment I came to India to help the Akanksha Foundation capture the voices and stories of the children, parents, school leaders and staff who are central to the success of this groundbreaking project. My goal was to help promote the Foundation’s strong work across their 16 schools in Mumbai and Pune. In my day-to-day work at home, I’m responsible for media relations at the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority. I also volunteer my time with Public Relations Without Borders (PRWB), a not-for-profit charity that works with partner organisations like Akanksha, to bring social and economic progress within populations faced with developmental challenges. Sounds complicated? It isn’t. The equation is pretty simple: the better an NGO can communicate with its audiences, the better it can carry out its mission, and make a greater contribution to the sustainable improvement of living conditions in the populations it serves. This is how I came to be associated with Akanksha and this is where I encountered hope.A universe of hopeFrom the moment I sat down in that taxi at Mumbai airport, I was immersed in a universe of hope. Over the next eight days, I would have the privilege of meeting and discussing with the agents of hope: the men and women of Akanksha who contribute to the empowerment of children from low-income communities. They literally transform lives, one child at a time, one community at a time. Hope is what you see in the eyes of the children and parents benefiting from the work of Akanksha. Everywhere I went, I heard the same testimonies over and over again. The kids loved their school and the parents would go to extraordinary lengths to make sure their kids stayed and graduated from Akanksha schools.Reforms and meaningful changeThe Foundation’s goal is to initiate reforms in the education system. Being a parent myself, I have witnessed countless attempts at so called reforms in the North American education system. All of them ended up in fiascos, with no positive and lasting impact on what should have been at the heart of the reforms - the children. Reforms developed for administrative purposes by adults who are far removed from the classroom are bound to fail. This is why I was a little skeptical at first. How can a small organisation like Akanksha, working in such a big country, with such immense education challenges, make a lasting and positive contribution?After speaking with Matthew Corallo, Akansha’s Chief Learning Officer, I came to realise that the word “reform” was an understatement, revolution would have been more appropriate. The quest for meaningful change had brought Matthew to Mumbai from New York. After a successful 20-year career in the American education system, he became disillusioned with the failed attempts at reform. Simply recycling the same wornout teaching methods and finding new ways of reporting them, just wasn’t cutting it anymore. “What they were calling reform was becoming a little conventional,” said Matthew. He was looking for a place that matched his philosophy for education.Matthew Corallo | Chief Learning Officer, Akanksha Every child should have a joyful, rigorous school day which is aimed at them taking ownership over their learning.Children and communities at the centre It may sound simple, but it is not. The risk of falling back into old educational models that have failed elsewhere is omnipresent. Placing the children at the centre of all your actions shouldn't just be an objective on a Department of Education White Paper. It has to be real, grounded in schools and in communities. I can testify to the fact that Akanksha is keeping it real! Everywhere I went, I heard students and parents talk about how they are taking ownership of the learning process, and how their feedback is an integral part of the school’s decisions and initiatives.Matthew Corallo intends to keep it that way with a decentralized, but coherent approach. As Chief Learning Officer for the entire network of Akanksha schools, he doesn’t see his role as policing the schools into a one-size-fits-all model. On the contrary, when he gets to work every day, he asks himself and his team the same question: how can we support our school leaders in their unique space, with their own unique challenges?Each school is different and has its own realities. When an issue is identified, whether academic or social, it is tackled head on, with the involvement of every student, parent, community leader and school leadership representative. No problem is left unanswered because it’s too complicated or too sensitive. For Akanksha, the school is an extension of the community, and a solution cannot be found without its involvement. Another key to success, according to Matthew Corallo, is flexibility.The education super stars!As I visited six different schools in Mumbai and Pune, I was able to appreciate the various challenges of each community. What struck me the most was the quality, the passion and the dedication of school leaders. If the education world had star quality like you see in the movies or big business, then Akanksha school leaders would be on the cover of every magazine. School leaders are agents of hope. They are grounded in their community, and care deeply about their students’ learning experiences. They know fully well that it is the only path that can take their students out of the poverty cycle. Their mission isn’t to ensure successful completion of their elementary school, but rather to holistically develop young citizens who will bring a positive contribution to society. Everything that stands in their way is tackled: low academic results, malnutrition, substance abuse, violence at home, etc.How hope materialises- In Pune's KC Thackeray Vidya Niketan School, school leader Shalini Sachdev is attracting international accolades by bringing her school into Ashoka’s Changemaker Schools Network. The school is one of only six in India to have been selected to be part of this network. Through innovations in school curricula, culture and systems, these schools believe that education can cultivate children as change-makers.- At the Abhyudaya Nagar Mumbai Public School in Pune, school leader Chitra Vishwanath wanted to instill a greater sense of responsibility within her students. She thought they were lacking focus and motivation. So, using best practices from other schools and feedback from her students, she created the 'portfolio project'. Work projects and grades would be compiled into a portfolio. Students would be able to track their evolution and where they needed to improve. They were asked to set goals and resolutions for themselves, and share these with their parents. They took ownership of the initiative and their sense of responsibility and level of motivation improved significantly.- At the Savitribai Phule School in Pune, Rahul Gupta, a 26-year-old rising star in the Akanksha network, has taken a struggling school and is dramatically improving its performance on all levels. When he took over, 40% of grade four students didn’t know the alphabet. Most of them were functioning at grade one level in this respect. In addition, motivation was very low and students were losing hope. This was a situation that was completely unacceptable for Rahul. With his team of teachers, he put in place intervention programs that are designed to help struggling students bridge learning gaps and bring them closer to where they need to be at a specific age. Struggling children were given special assignments until they were able to reintegrate into their normal group. Results immediately started to improve. Some students were able to bridge a three-year gap in only one year.- At Shindewadi School in Mumbai, school leader Rashmi Chainani is dealing with social issues that can negatively impact her students’ learning. Working with her teachers, social workers and parents, she is tackling these problems one at a time. The school is inviting parents to come in and discuss the importance of sanitation and certain health measures they can take at home. The school organises parent classes where they learn to make better decisions for their family, especially when it comes to nutrition and managing the family budget. As part of their empowerment class, ninth grade students are working on a project in partnership with Alcoholics Anonymous aimed at curbing alcohol addiction and substance abuse in their community. All these initiatives contribute to a more positive environment in which children and parents can learn, and become better citizens in the process.Each Akanksha school has its own success stories. The ability of each school leader to adapt and include all voices in their problem-solving procedures is making this network unique in the world.The West can certainly learn a lot from what is taking place in India. The communities I visited are facing issues that don’t exist in most North American communities. Yet, learning in Akanksha schools continues to take place, and at a steady pace. It continues despite serious social problems, crumbling infrastructure, and abject poverty. The fact that this is happening is the very essence of hope. The agents of hope are the school leaders, their teams and the group of professionals at Akanksha that stoke and keep this revolution alive. Schools around the world should follow Akanksha principles that are based on continuous improvement, inclusion, real dialogue, flexibility and adaptability. Yes, there is hope!",https://www.dnaindia.com/blogs/post-education-superstars-how-the-akanksha-foundation-is-an-agent-of-hope-for-students-2126737
dna exclusive: Over 600 non-educational organisations continue to occupy premises of BMC schools even after lease expiry,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/1934765.jpg,2013-12-14T08:19:50,"More than nine months after it served notices on 98 ‘non-educational’ organisations operating from 628 classrooms in civic-run schools, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is clueless about freeing the space. Worse, the civic body needs nearly 400 additional classrooms for its students in the next academic year.A myriad of organisations, including union offices, yoga institutes, NGOs and banks, continue to occupy space in municipal schools despite expiry of their annual lease on March 31. The BMC had asked them to move out in April.A top BMC education official told dna, “Only four of the 628 classrooms have been vacated so far. We are seeking details from all wards in this regard.” The official said all these four organisations were from zone 2, which includes Worli, Dadar, Matunga, Mahim and Wadala – the civic administration has divided the city into seven zone.Currently, over 3.8 lakh students study in more than 1,074 primary schools. The number will go up by 25,000 in the coming academic year as Std 8 has now been included in elementary education. At present, only 20 new classrooms are under construction for Std 8.Many of these non-educational organisations have been functioning from civic school premises since decades by paying a nominal rent. Over 70 per cent of the space have been occupied by several workers unions, mehandi-dance-tailoring classes, store rooms, NGOs like Praja, Pratham, private offices, government offices, printing press, religious groups, satsang-yoga classes etc (dna has a copy of the list).While some schools have 3-5 organisations operating from the premises, some organisations occupy classrooms in many schools, some others operate few hours a day. Over 86 classrooms are being used by NGOs related to AIDS, cancer, special children and de-addiction centres etc.Ramesh Joshi, president of municipal schools teachers association said, “The notices have been given to only those organisations which run non-educational activities. No action is intended on private schools and coaching classes which operate from civic school premises. BMC puts these profiteering centres under ‘educational’ activity”.Joshi said these activities undermine the sanctity of the schools and affecting the credibility of civic education. “This is a deliberate attempt of the officials, politicians and so-called NGOs to kill the public education system.”Parents say children get distracted because of multiple activities going around. They fear this will affect the performances of the students.This show of inefficiency by BMC’s education department comes in the wake of a study, revealing that poor quality of education in civic schools forces parents to opt for private institutes. Only 17 per cent of families send their wards to BMC schools, said the study.Sunil Dhamne, deputy municipal commissioner (education) confirmed that four classrooms have been vacated so far. He said, “We are still seeking information from all the wards, hence we are unable to tell exactly how many of them have vacated.”On their strategy to reclaim the classrooms, Dhamne said, “There are some NGOs like Hellen Keller and Alcoholic Anonymous which are doing good work. Also, there are some agencies which prepare materials for some schools. We are contemplating if we can put them under educational activities.” Dhamne added, “Many children have been going to nearby aided schools. Besides, we are is readying 20 classrooms.”(With inputs from Vinamrata Borwankar)",https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-dna-exclusive-over-600-non-educational-organisations-continue-to-occupy-premises-of-bmc-schools-even-after-lease-expiry-1934764

He is forced by circumstances to enter into crime at a very young age.

But he is also revered for his intrinsic goodness, his sense of honour and humanity. He extorts money from the rich, only to help those in need.Ashish says his character is loosely based on Sri Prakash Shukla, a young mafia don from UP who was killed in an encounter last year.""The background of my character is the same as that of Shukla,"" said Ashish, who got rid of his chiselled gym-physique in order to look like a goon from the heartland.""I had to get rid of my six packs and get into the 'akhada' look and shift from diet food to doodh malai,"" he added.This is his first television show and the Jaipur-based actor was initially apprehensive about taking it up as he doesn't approve of the process behind making soaps and serials.""I took up this show only because the process of making it was not like the usual soaps. We had a month-long workshop before shooting to get my dialect right and get into the feel of the character. The preparations were just like making a film,"" said Ashish.The actor has two films in the pipeline, which will go on floors shortly. The first, Dillogical, is about the growing tendency among youngsters to commit suicide under pressures in life. The other one is named Youthopia and is the story of four kids and a cartoonist.",https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-lsd-actor-turns-into-small-screen-robin-hood-1440078
Con Banega Crorepati? An ex-alcoholic in Bangalore,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2011-12-21T09:24:00,"The going couldn’t have been better for 48-year-old BE graduate and a rehabilitated alcoholic, Srinivas, who laughed all the way to the bank while illegally detaining 112 alleged drug and alcohol addicts on the pretext of treating them at a de-addition centre. He had designed the centre — “Star Life De-Addiction Centre”, located in Gulakamale village, Kaggalipura Cross, on Kanakapura Road — on the lines of CARE Rehab Centre which had rehabilitated him earlier, with the difference that Srinivas (who has also done a PhD) did not provide any treatment, but only ill-treatment to his inmates. That too, at a high price that each inmate had to pay from his pocket: Rs5,000-Rs15,000 per month for the “treatment”.However, the centre, which was ideally suited to house only 50 patients, had no doctors, and the inmates were ill-treated, many among them being forced to clean up toilets and beaten up if they resisted. The rescued inmates have revealed that Srinivas and four of his employees regularly beat them up.But it all came to an end on Tuesday when a person, whose identity has been withheld, chose to complain to the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) about the pathetic conditions in which these so-called addicts were forced to live.The SHRC team, headed by its registrar, Malleshappa, and Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP), Ashwathanarayana, found the centre to be lacking in basic amenities; and, worse, they discovered that although the inmates were detained on the pretext of being treated, there was no such thing given to them, and there were no proper doctors to attend to them.SHRC chairman, Justice SR Nayak, directed that the 112 inmates be sent to their respective homes by Wednesday.The SHRC has filed a complaint against Srinivas, his employeesPalani, Mani, Abraham and Shiva Kumar with Talaghattapura police station. The police registered a case of illegal detention against them.“He treated them with whatever little knowledge he had gained when he was admitted to ‘Care’ addiction centre in Hulimavu, where he was earlier treated,” Ashwathanarayana said.One of the patients, identified as Ramakrishna, who was allegedly regularly beaten up by Srinivas and his employees has filed a case of assault against them with Talaghattapura police.The SHRC team was also shocked to find a retired sub-inspector of police, Siddalingaiah, who was attached to Kalasipalyam police station. SHRC team members said Siddalingaiah began to cry when he saw them, and told them that he was forcibly brought to the centre after someone complained to Srinivas that he was an alcoholic needing rehabilitation.",https://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-con-banega-crorepati-an-ex-alcoholic-in-bangalore-1628360
Escaping the vice-like grip: Experts and recovering addicts show the way,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/26/757756-jbm-drugs.jpg,2018-11-26T00:00:00,"While Canada's legalising recreational cannabis last month, made Mary Jane lovers across the globe go green with envy, it's fascinating to note how the Government of Canada has listed the ill-effects of this psychoactive drug on its official website (www.canada.ca/en/services/health/campaigns/cannabis/health-effects.html). It includes attention-deficiency, poor decision-making, mood swings, and psychosis as short term drawbacks, and lung and breathing problems and addiction – much to the angst of those patrons and health experts who state otherwise – as long terms effects. The page also reveals facts such as 'Close to 1 in 10 adults who have ever used cannabis will develop an addiction to it. This statistic rises to about 1 in 6 for people who started using cannabis as a teenager', 'Between 1 in 4 and 1 in 2 of those who smoke cannabis daily will develop an addiction to it', and that 'THC, the substance which gives the ""high"" in cannabis, affects the same machinery in the brain that directs brain development'.Funnily, according to the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and Addiction, Canadians between 15-24 are some of the highest cannabis users in the world. Also, despite the above warnings, cannabis centres in Canada have begun to go out of stock every week. It has propelled the rise of black market marijuana and citizens not abiding by Canada's zero-tolerance policy of driving under the influence of the drug.While there's a high possibility that Canada's decision may go down the pot, on this note, the question to be asked is, what makes someone hooked on to life-threatening and negatively brain-altering substances such as drugs, opioid painkillers, sedatives, inhalants, tobacco, alcohol, etc.? And is it possible to stop?Cause & effectThe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) defines addiction as ""a complex condition, a brain disease that is manifested by compulsive substance use despite harmful consequence"". And that this 'disease' has no cure because recovery from it is not foolproof given the high probability of relapse. But Scientific American, the US-based award-winning authoritative source for the scientific discoveries, argues that calling substance addiction a disease paints its users in a sympathetic light, taking away the responsibility from their culpable actions. It also states users don't need rehab and are capable of battling their cravings for good. Researchers, however, unanimously agree that an individual's genetic predisposition, behaviour and environment are the three predominant causes for any kind of addiction/s to develop.Rev Fr Joe H Pereira, Founder Trustee of Kripa Foundation – an NGO that rehabilitates people afflicted with chemical dependency and HIV Infection, and has 72 centres in India and worldwide – says substance addiction is inherited. So if your father chain smokes or your grandfather was an alcoholic, chances of you possibly getting addicted to that specific substance are high. The 76-year-old Padma Shri awardee observes, ""Nobody coming for de-addiction is the first in his/her gharana."" This thought connects to the Alcohol and Drugs: A Parent's Guide 2018 report by Ireland's Health Service Executive that warns parents from letting their kids see them drunk, proudly sharing their drunken and/or drug stories or addressing stress with 'I need a drink after the day I've had' attitude that normalises these vices, and can encourage your teen to drink more, outside home.Secondly, behaviour choices can make way for addictions. ""Today, children are given iPads as pacifiers and taught to run after something they want. In the process, we're creating 'king babies' – adults with an infantile psyche, who continue to want something to pacify themselves with,"" says Fr Pereira.Third factor is the peer group, as 'birds of a feather flock together'. Case in point is 72-year-old *Merwin R, a veteran counselor at a Mumbai-based de-addiction centre. ""I had the gift of the gab, a boon in my sales and marketing profession. I made friends easily... too many friends actually, and that became my weakness."" From drinking beer with his friends and at every office party, he switched to hard liquor on realising it costs lesser and gives a better high. In time, he'd finish one whole bottle daily, neat. ""I was very good in organising get-togethers. But after each one, I had to be carried home, completely drunk. My lifestyle led to absenteeism and I lost my job.""Then 23 years ago, he hit rock bottom. Post binge-drinking with friends one evening, Merwin lost consciousness. He woke up outside Victoria Gardens, Byculla, and for 22 days, lay inebriated and drinking madly with no recollection who supplied the alcohol. In the process, his watch, gold chain, and even shoes were stolen. As if by miracle, Mother Teresa passed by in an ambulance and saw him and took him to Ashadaan, an NGO run by Missionaries of Charity. He was in such a bad state that the sisters prepared his death certificate. But Merwin survived, and later joined the same rehab he's now a staff at.His drinking buddies, however, were not lucky. ""Couple of years later, when I went to get my friends to attend the 12-step program, at every door I knocked, I was told that the person was no more. All dead in their 50's, mostly from liver cirrhosis. I could've been one of them…""Merwin still socialises, but sticks to his soft drinks even when egged on to drink alcohol. ""I just go to test myself...""Sex & porn addiction, toughest to battle""When an average person drinks more than usual, his/her brain sends out a warning signal. But those prone to addictions, don't get receive such signals,"" says Dr Pratima Murthy, Professor, Dept of Psychiatry, & Chief, De-addiction Services National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru.Agreeing with Murthy, is *Mehul, a poly-addict [multiple substance user]. He had done a six-month rehab stint in 2009 to quit the trinity of alcohol, drug and nicotine addiction, but relapsed on getting out because ""a stay in rehab usually dries a using person, but to stay clean when outside in the society, one has to work the 12 steps of AA."" Finally in 2011, after the standard 90-day, he was successful in laying his demons to rest for good. While he's resisted a relapse till now, he fell into sex and porn addiction. Mehul breaks it down simply. ""Non-addicts won't keep haggling over an issue that's long over, but we [users] continue to bottle all the hate, jealousy, anger or shame in our mind. When I drank, doped or watched porn, it felt so good. So when I'm not feeling good when I feel all these emotions, my mind knows how to make me feel good, and suggests, 'go have a drink'. The problem is, people like me, once we start we cannot stop."" But Mehul disagrees with the assumption that substance dependants have no willpower. ""Even the worst of drunks, when they promise they won't drink, they don't. But gradually, they start obsessing about these emotions, which causes a build-up till the mind can resist no longer, and then willpower goes out.""Mehul remembers his days of chasing the high, frequenting massage parlours, five-star hotels and red-light areas. ""One woman could not satisfy me. I needed threesomes and BDSM. If I slept with someone 3-4 times, I'd get bored. During work, I'd think of who to have sex with at night. Getting on with women, for me, was like changing clothes. I paid well to get reality as close to porn. I didn't understand the [dating] drill of meeting for coffee, going on dates and waiting to have sex,"" he says. He realised he had a problem when one day he went on a porn-watching binge for six hours. Mehul then enrolled at Sexoholics Anonymous (SA) that operates from the US, but has members in India. Some may find SA's sobriety commandments rigid – no sex if single, only sex with spouse, and no masturbating. ""But sex addiction is the toughest! Substance addictions involve an external intake, but with sex, I have the memory of things I've seen and done, where lust is the drug. Hard to forget.""Mehul is now dating someone he's in love with. She forgave him despite the fact he had cheated on her. ""There were more affairs she doesn't know about, but I straightened up not just for her, but also because the way I was going. I was a mess, I was dying,"" says the now ardent follower of Sadguru and Eckhart Tole.But forming a Sex Anon group in India that comprises both men and women has proven impossible. ""My three attempts to have one in Bandra, fizzled out. People here speak about sexual weakness and promiscuity, and are worried they might fall [for members of the other gender],"" says Fr Pereira. As SA members only connect with each other online, they've managed to include one female member, ""but we've not actively involved her,"" says Mehul.Cigarette, the first stepMany treat smoking as a lesser evil to drinking and drugs, given that we don't hear of Smokers Anonymous given the number AA, NA and SA groups. But experts state that this a gross miscalculation. ""I've had patients who gave up alcohol, but not smoking and ended up dying from lung cancer,"" cautions Dr Murthy about cigarettes being a gateway to other vices.Consider the case of *Henry R, who became a full-blown heroin addict by 16. He was a star student, a junior-level player with the state football club, and secured the 18th rank in state-level aptitude test.But after Class 10, his active smoking to fit into an 'older' crowd, saw him finish two WIN king-sized packs – 40 cigarettes, every day. ""I was largely influenced by my friends' circle to experiment with drugs, and finally heroin. By day four of trying heroin, I couldn't stop. Heroin became my first love. It put me in a tension-free place and let me trip on my own. On it, I could study, play football, give a speech in public confidently. So despite OD'ing three times, I was in complete denial."" To afford his drug, Henry used up his scholarship funds and pocket money, made a duplicate key to steal from his mother's cupboard, and once, even slapped his mother when she refused to spare him money. His parents got to know about his condition after the cops caught him in possession of heroin.Finally, Henry buckled and his parents put him in rehab. ""The first three days were the toughest of my life. The withdrawals were unbearable. I would shiver, get feverish, was scared to touch water, felt dirty, had no energy or appetite, suffered headaches, sleepless nights, and had the sensation of a mouse running down my back..."" Now clean for three years, Henry is yet to kick the butt, although he's reduced to smoking five cigarettes per day.Relapse, not the endAfter 90 days rehab and nine months of extended care, Henry relapsed to brown sugar. ""Even alcohol is not safe for me. So I'm careful all the time."" But relapse shouldn't deter an individual, for whom it might take 4-5 slip offs to block his/her demons for good, says Murthy, adding, ""People relapse from hypertension, diabetes, bronchial asthma, and even cancer, so why not an addiction? Relapse doesn't indicate failure of the treatment, but offers the person to correct themselves quickly and move on."" People get restored to normalcy when they stop doing what harms them. ""Relapse is just the brain taking time to reboot to way it was before [the addiction/s],"" says Mehul, who now maintains a circle of few, close friends that don't engage in discussing women, sexually.Despite relapsing, many like Merwin, Henry and Mehul are determined to fight their addictions with resilience. Merwin is going strong, despite surviving his third massive heart attack about a month ago. Henry feels lucky for not having contracted Hepatitis C or HIV, despite using shared needles for drug injection. He sings, plays the guitar and volleyball, goes clubbing without getting high like everyone around him, and is associated with a de-addiction centre, and at 22, counsels ""people older than my father"". But he gets exhausted after a 15-minute run when few years ago a 90-minute game of football, for him, was a breeze. ""But I have no regrets, except slapping my mother,"" he recalls with remorse.Do they manage sobriety with elan? For Mehul, every day is a challenge. ""Just yesterday, I fought the urge to call this escort I'd slept with before."" Instead now, he plays sports, treks and even sponsor a child's education to achieve that feel-good factor. ""Sometimes I crave for it,"" says Henry. ""Then I remember my horrible withdrawals and call my sponsor [mentor, ex-user who has completely recovered] instead. For us [recovering addicts], one [puff] is too much and a 1,000, never enough.""The way forwardThe standard 90-day 12-step recovery program from any addiction is what most de-addiction centres abide by. In a bid to salvage dropouts and relapses, Kripa, however, takes a more holistic approach. ""We've modified the 12-step program that mainly teaches how to stay away from the first puff, keep buddies who are winners, and practice meditation."" The program was tweaked to make it engaging for young users. ""In 1981, we received patients between 45 to 55 years old. Now, people young as 14 to 24-year-olds walk in,"" says Fr Pereira, a pupil of BKS Iyengar, who also infuses Iyengar yoga techniques to the rehab program. NIMHANS has developed a ""therapeutic alliance"" – if the person doesn't get treated in the 90-day program or drops out, the counsellor continues to keep in touch with them, gradually encouraging them to join back. ""A non-judgmental, empathetic approach is required to address the underlying problems that began the addiction in the first place,"" says Dr Murthy.*Names changes to protect identity",https://www.dnaindia.com/just-before-monday/report-escaping-the-vice-like-grip-2688927
Eight-year-old Kerala boy dies after drinking excess alcohol,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2014/01/22/1954422.jpg,2014-01-22T00:00:00,"The alarming alcohol addiction of Kerala has claimed an eight-year old boy. A class five student, Lejin, a native of Kunnikode in Kollam district, died in the wee hours of Monday following excess consumption of Bacardi Gold rum when his parents and brother were not at home.On Sunday afternoon Lejin was alone at home as his mother Susan and brother Lebin were away to attend a funeral, and his father Laaji had gone to his sister’s house. Little Lejin was, perhaps, waiting for this opportunity to consume the liquor. He had seen his father and his friends drink at home in his presence.When his parents and brother returned around six in the evening, they found the unconscious Lejin lying on his bed, bathed in vomit and urine. The TV, which had been playing when they had left, was still on. From the smell, they realised what had happened. Immediately, they washed and rushed him to a nearby private hospital.Dr Firoz, who treated the boy, told dna that Lejin had been brought in an unconscious state and he regained normalcy half an hour after the drugs were administered intravenously. The boy was alright till mid-night. He went to the loo without help. But his condition deteriorated suddenly and he breathed his last around one O clock in the morning.“I had told his parents to take him to a bigger hospital as large quantity of liquor plays tricks on children, but since he was found to be normal they did not heed my advice. I don’t know what went wrong,’’ the doctor said.Dr Firoz said that Lejin had told him that he had drunk liquor which his father kept at home. “He must have taken about 300 to 400 ml of the stuff. He didn’t tell me whether he had taken it dry or diluted. Children don’t withstand such huge quantities of alcohol,’’ Firoz added.Sub inspector Vijoy who is investigating the case told dna that the forensic surgeon who conducted the postmortem examination informed him that the boy died of brain inflammation caused by excess consumption of alcohol. The surgeon also confirmed that the boy must have taken nearly 400 ml of the stuff.“We could not collect any evidence from the scene because the room where the boy had been found unconscious was washed on the presumption that there won’t be any police case.’’ Vijoy said.“I quit drinking and smoking six months back. This bottle of alcohol was given by a friend of mine working in the Gulf. Since I stopped drinking, my friends were consuming it when they dropped in at my place. I did not know that the boy was keenly watching it,” Laaji, who is a petty floor tiling contractor, said in a choked voice.Kerala, which consumed liquor worth Rs8,842 core in 2012-13 fiscal (Rs7,860 in the previous year), shows the symptoms of an acute alcoholic society. Various studies have warned the authorities that drinking habit is rampant even among school kids. The alcohol-related crimes, family feuds and ailments are on the rise in the state, which is the largest guzzler among all Indian states. But the government is very reluctant to regulate the liquor flow as it is the main revenue of the exchequer.",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-eight-year-old-kerala-boy-dies-after-drinking-excess-alcohol-1954421
"Students bare souls, and more, on Facebook 'confession' pages",[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2013-03-19T08:23:24,"""I'm a compulsive laundry room thief,"" says one Facebook confession. ""I'm the reason the 'Public Urination is Illegal' signs were put up at Coyote Village,"" says another. ""I sold books for the semester to go to South Padre for spring break ... Gotta pay for the booze somehow,"" reveals yet another poster. By turns rueful and raunchy, these anonymous admissions pop up on 'campus confession' pages unofficially linked to scores of high schools and universities.Like many social media trends, the confession craze captivates teenagers and 20-somethings - but alarms teachers, law enforcement officers and counsellors. ""It's another creative venue where kids are able to say hurtful things, and that's frustrating,"" said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center at Florida Atlantic University.At the same time, the pages can sometimes offer a catharsis of sorts, attracting heartfelt disclosures from students struggling with depression, alcoholism or eating disorders. Classmates often respond with links to counselling sites and offers to talk. The anonymity of confession pages is at the core of their appeal, and they use a simple workaround to Facebook's general insistence that people use their real identity on the social network. Students who set up confessional pages must do so under their real names, as per Facebook policy.But they can choose to cloak their identity as page administrators. To keep posts anonymous, they use free online survey tools such as SurveyMonkey or Google Forms. Confessors simply click on a link to open up a blank box where they can type their tell-all. The page administrator doesn't see identifying information - just the latest confession.The pages then prompt visitors to show admiration for the juiciest confessions by ""liking"" them and posting comments - often smart-aleck remarks that can draw fan bases of their own. ""The more outrageous comments attract more attention ... so there's little incentive to exercise restraint,"" Hinduja said. Alisen Lafaive found that out quickly when she began reading the Facebook confession page for Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. ""At first, I thought, 'Ooh, Clarkson Confessions! This ought to be juicy!'"" said Lafaive, a junior. Then she began scrolling through posts filled with crude invective toward women.""These things are mean,"" she said. ""My feelings are hurt even though none of it's directed toward me."" She posted a plea for courtesy but was ignored. The confessions pages do not violate Facebook rules so long as the content remains within the bounds of civility, said a spokeswoman for the social network.But the pages have drawn complaints from some from principals, college administrators and police. Dismayed by the content on two high-school confession pages in Kalispell, Montana last month, police asked Facebook to shut them down. Facebook closed one and removed offensive comments from another - but the student instigators simply started a third page, said Jason Parce, a police officer in Kalispell.Parce threatened to charge participants with defamation and they quickly pulled down their posts. Though some posts were anonymous, many comments came in through Facebook accounts so the writers could easily be identified. ""There was a lot of sexually explicit content directed at specific individuals and a lot of hateful language being used,"" said Parce.""Absolutely, kids are more willing to be crude when they don't have to face anyone. They hide behind the computer."" High-school pages in Idaho and Arizona have also been shut down after school officials moved to investigate offensive posts.Administrators of several confession sites told Reuters that they review each submission and refuse to post any that seem inappropriate. Facebook also routinely reviews pages on its site and responds to any complaints about content. If its reviewers deem a post objectionable, the social network will remove it or shut down the site entirely, the Facebook spokeswoman said. None of these safeguards can determine whether those posting and commenting on confessions are bona fide students of a particular school.At the college level, the concern isn't bullying so much as brand protection. Universities including San Francisco State have asked confession sites to stop using school logos and photographs of iconic buildings for fear that outsiders might mistake the many tales of alcohol-fuelled sexual conquests for an official depiction of campus life.Despite, or perhaps because of, official disapproval, the fad continues to gain steam - and may be helping Facebook regain some of its allure among teens and college students. A recent poll by an online survey tool, Survata, found teens and young adults aged 13 to 25 used micro-blogging platform Tumblr more than Facebook. Scores of Facebook confession pages have popped up in recent months, at small private colleges and huge state universities. Princeton, Harvard and Yale have pages.So does Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon. Some campuses have Twitter confession accounts as well but Facebook remains the most popular medium. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's confessions page has racked up more than 21,000 Facebook ""likes."" The University of Hawaii at Manoa has nearly 12,000. College students in India, New Zealand and Great Britain are baring their secrets online, too. ""It just makes me laugh,"" said Matt Miller, a biology major at the University of Hawaii who checks out his classmates' confessions several times a day.Among the recent posts: a lament about the difficulty of conversing with beautiful brunettes, an admission about a romantic relationship with a teaching assistant, and a cryptic, ""Majoring in mathematics. Judge me."" The campus confessionals teem with references to specific dorms, classes, fraternities and traditions, giving them an intimate, gossip-over-coffee feel.Many have also become forums for posting secret crushes: ""To the boy in Art History with the long hair and blue shoes. You're so cute!!"" The pages can also offer a lifeline to struggling students. ""I want to pass on hope to people who feel like they don't have any,"" said Stephanie Suchecki, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay who makes a point of responding to the most wrenching posts.Moments of compassion, however, are often swamped by the lewd and the crude - just how some confession junkies like it. An administrator of the Arizona State University confessions site recently goaded readers to ramp up their revelations: ""What happened to your crazy stories!?!? Hook ups gone bad?! Party gone crazy?! Come on guys! This is ASU!""",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-students-bare-souls-and-more-on-facebook-confession-pages-1812949
How to beat a hangover after that Christmas party,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/all/themes/dnaindia/favicon-1016.ico,2010-12-09T21:25:45,"After a hard night on the booze, you would do or pay just about anything to ease the headache, the nausea and the feeling as though you're as dry as the Great Sandy Desert.Over-indulging in alcohol is likely during the Christmas ‘silly season’, but always stick to the proverb ‘prevention is better than cure’.While, the Internet bursts with tips and tricks to speed up the recovery from the more ‘self-induced morning sickness’, an Australian nurse, who wishes to remain anonymous, has revealed some of the medical guild's most coveted secrets, reports Stuff.co.nz.“When some doctors or nurses have a bad hangover, they sometimes self-administer intravenous fluids or put on an oxygen mask for a while,” she said.Perth-based National Drug Research Institute director Steven Allsop said he was familiar with the unorthodox practices, having heard about them ‘in medical school 30 years ago’.Breathing in pure oxygen with a mask could help ease fatigue and oxygen-depletion caused by an alcohol binge, while an IV drip could help alleviate the effects of dehydration a little faster than drinking fluids, he said.Allsop said while science to date didn't offer one single cure to relieve the sufferer, there were a variety of reasons why we feel bad when we drink.“Some of it has to do with the metabolites from alcohol, and one of them is acetaldehyde, which is highly toxic and can make you feel very, very poorly,” he said.“Alcohol is also diuretic, so you become dehydrated and that's a particular issue in a country like ours, and some quench their thirst with alcohol, which is the worst thing you could do. It also impairs your sleep. You do fall asleep quickly initially, but it disturbs that deep, restful REM sleep,” he added.Megan Alsford, a dietician with the Dietitian Association of Australia, said the loss of electrolytes, low blood sugar and damage to the lining of the digestive tract also added to the poorly feeling after too much alcohol.She said there while there was no magic hangover cure, a sure bet to feel better was drinking plenty of water or an electrolyte-replacement drink and eating some fruit.“One sure fire way of not getting a hangover is not to overdo it on the alcohol - prevention is better than cure”, she added.“Have a glass of water in between each alcoholic drink, as one of the reasons for a hangover is dehydration. This method can prevent dehydration and slow yourself down so you don't drink as much,” said Alsford.",https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-how-to-beat-a-hangover-after-that-christmas-party-1479127
Murdochs decide to oust Fox News chief Roger Ailes over sexual harassment case - report,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2016/07/19/483284-roger-ailes-and-gretchen.jpg,2016-07-19T00:00:00,"Rupert Murdoch, executive co-chairman of 21st Century Fox Inc, and his sons James and Lachlan agree that Fox News Channel boss Roger Ailes should leave the company but they have not settled on the timing, New York magazine reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson has sued Ailes, claiming sexual harassment. Ailes has denied the charges. Fox hired the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct an internal investigation. ""This matter is not yet resolved and the review is not concluded,"" 21st Century Fox said in a statement after the report surfaced. Julie Henderson, a spokeswoman for 21st Century Fox, declined to comment beyond the statement.An attorney for Ailes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A lawyer for Carlson declined to comment on the report. New York magazine reported that two sources briefed on the investigation said that all three Murdochs ""have settled on removing"" the 76-year-old Ailes. Lachlan Murdoch is executive co-chairman of 21st Century Fox and James Murdoch is chief executive officer. After reviewing the initial findings of the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison investigation, James Murdoch ""is said to be arguing that Ailes should be presented with a choice this week to resign or face being fired,"" the magazine reported.Lachlan ""is more aligned with their father, who thinks that no action should be taken until after the GOP convention this week,"" the magazine reported. Ailes was a consultant for several US Republican presidents, including George H.W. Bush. He has been a confidant of 21st Century Fox Executive Co-Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who named him founding chief executive of Fox News Channel in 1996. Under Ailes' leadership, Fox News has become the top-rated U.S. cable news channel.Ailes said in a statement after Carlson's lawsuit was filed that he would defend himself against ""false"" and ""offensive"" allegations.Removing Ailes now, in the thick of a presidential election campaign, could pose a challenge for the network, said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute.

An unhappy alcoholic lawyer meets a seductive heiress and the backwaters of Pondicherry begin to steam and sizzle.

A dejected girl with starry dreams becomes a high class hooker eventually falling in love with a millionaire.

One of those films for which the phrase 'guilty pleasure' was invented.Maya MemsaabSheeshaJulieHawas6. The film is loosely based on Ismat Chughtai's 1942 story, Lihaaf (The Quilt). It became the first mainstream film in India to explicitly show homosexual relations between two women, making this a sharp-social commentary, about an emotional oddity.

How P2P lending can be a route to creating financial inclusion,[],https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2017/11/16/625094-fintech-thinkstock-111617.jpg,2017-11-16T00:00:00,"We live in an ever-evolving technology-driven era, impacting our everyday lives. The ‘millennials’ across various geo-demographics have the advantage of being in a technology-developing world. We are digitally equipped, right from gathering global information to networking, ordering food, shopping, and almost for everything.Owing to this massive transformation of the digital world, businesses have risen in terms of quality, quantity and scale. This form of technology has given birth to a proliferating industry called the fintech industry, a combination that allows technology to enhance financial services.For years, banks have had a monopoly in lending money to businesses and individuals. However, the 2007-08 financial crisis created a havoc, rapidly-expanding the funding gap. This led to the advent of a niche fintech vertical, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.The industry looks to address the very basic credit requirements of a major chunk of the population. In the current scenario, banks generally take more than a week to process the entire loan application. This can be a long time for someone with an immediate requirement like a medical emergency. Banks have also seen an increase in the number of loan application rejections. Only the ones with a strong credit score, typically a 750 out of 900, are able to get loans. Furthermore, one also needs to be a good salaried individual, with approximately two years of quality corporate standing.Here, P2P lending platforms come as life savers. The eligibility criteria is simple with minimum salary requirements. These platforms understand the users’ financial needs far better, enabling loan approvals and disbursals within two-three working days. The rise of P2P lending worldwide is mainly due to people projecting low credit scores or reasons that are unusual for banks in funding. P2P lending platforms enable a majority of such individuals in getting quick and easy loans. It also acts as an innovative platform for investors to lend their surplus funds to borrowers for better returns.The geographical reach of a P2P lending platform is far superior, with the major differentiator being its online interface. Such digital financial services play an important role in supporting the objective of financial inclusion. Anybody, from the remotest areas, having access to internet, can be eligible to get/give a loan. Having said that, P2P lending platforms follow a stringent verification model. The traditional underwriting processes adopted, have evolved with technology, proving beneficial in reducing the default rate of borrowers. There is still a lot of scope of advancement in this direction, towards which few players have already started gearing up.In the age of digitisation where almost everyone has access to internet, such platforms have the potential to change the financial graph of a country. Although relatively young, the fintech market is undergoing a phase of rapid growth. It is forecasted to cross $2.4 billion by 2020, as per reports by KPMG India and Nasscom. A promising growth lies within the Indian market which can attain a size of $4-5 billion in the next five-six years. P2P lending as a technological invention sees an immense potential and will strive to restructure the financial sector and in turn bridge the widening financial gap. Moreover, the segment’s ability to use technology innovation to break geographical boundaries certainly will contribute to our goal as a nation for financial inclusion.The author is the CEO and founder, LenDenClub",https://www.dnaindia.com/personal-finance/report-how-p2p-lending-can-be-a-route-to-creating-financial-inclusion-2560256
