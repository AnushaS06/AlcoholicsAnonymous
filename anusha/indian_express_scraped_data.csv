			Consent in a man’s world		",Mrinal Pande,07 am,"The routines, stratagems, denials and traps in Indian workplaces still make easy mobility and maintaining dignity difficult even for the most talented young female journalists“If you want to know more about femininity, enquire from your own experience of life, or turn to people, or wait until science can give you deeper and more coherent information.” Sigmund Freud ends his essay, ‘On Femininity’, with these lines. They are a somewhat testy but frank acknowledgement of the limitations of even his own vast research on the subject. Today, we could do with some of that humility.In the decades since Freud wrote this, a new world order has risen and mutated. During the 1960s and ’70s, when this writer was living in the US, feminism was all about raising consciousness. That meant various women collectives getting together regularly outside of family circles, and sharing stories about their lives, like members of the Alcoholics Anonymous. At these meetings, after some hesitation, women emerged from being in denial and swapped intimate stories about relationships, work, life goals and sexuality. Tears flowed as they articulated the pain they felt, about the lack of protective nets they needed as young confused girls, the broken trust resulting in deep dilemmas they faced as daughters, wives, mothers. It was through these first-hand narrations that women realised their individual failures were not personal failures but stemmed from their gender being perceived as rooted in sex: Men defined themselves in law and life as aggressive and powerful and women as the receptacles for their sexual urges and producers of their legitimate offspring.Now, digital media has acquired a life of its own and become a public space that allows various marginalised groups to share their hitherto unpublicised insights about the power structures and hierarchies that exclude them but act as their authorised spokespersons. Of course, riding the great tidal wave of an open-ended show-and-tell has both a good and bad side to it. But it is because of this free space that, for the first time in India, working women are able to tell the world what it has actually been like to be at the receiving end of all those sexist jokes, misogyny, porn and rape or near-rape.It is entirely understandable that most of the first stories came from the media. Given the sheer mass of women in media today and their rise to positions of power, it makes sense that women reporters feel comfortable enough to blow the whistle, some after more than a decade, and discuss their harassment with clinical precision — with dates, times and places. Their tales are universal and reveal that the real problem is not that Indian men treat women badly (although they often do), but that at the workplace it remains a male prerogative to decide who to treat badly, how and how often, and what should be a suitable “punishment” for those who deny them sexual favours.The late Justice Leila Seth, who was on the committee that gave us the revised law against sexual harassment and rape, has observed in her book Talking of Justice: People’s Rights in Modern India: “The approach generally taken with gender equality is that women are different from men because they are weaker and more subordinate and consequently need protection… the protectionist approach actually reinforces the difference and perpetuates it.” The tales of sexual harassment — as they unfurl and multiply — prove her words. They reveal how in a work environment dominated by an extremely powerful near-tyrannical boss, the supposed power of a young female trainee to say “no” is actually the obfuscation of her actual lack of power to stop him without losing both her job and her reputation and maybe the possibility of getting another job. The routines, stratagems, denials and traps in Indian workplaces, laid bare by the young women’s testimonies before us, are what still makes easy mobility and maintaining their dignity well-nigh impossible even for the most talented young female journalists.Men in India, when they challenge a woman’s rape charge in court, will try to feed the still-pervasive belief that women fabricate rape charges after consenting to sex. According to them, women distort the experience. Men seldom consider the reality of sex as anything beyond their own experience of it. But as many stories that have surfaced of late reveal, in the mind of male sexual predators, sex actually represents and enforces the ultimate subordination of women to men. No wonder, then, they claim they thought her resistance or disinclination was a deliberate spur to more ardent love-making.Surely, in some cases, there may be incentives to lie. But the deeper problem is the frequent legal assumption that a single objective state of affairs existed. And it must be determined by evidence. Lawyers representing the perpetrator thus often go on to divide women into spheres of consent, according to the indices of their relationship to men. From the extent to which the perpetrator knows the victim and they have had sex, her consent is inferred. The inference is: Our client does not rape women he does not know. And if he knows them and has consensual sex with them, how can he be held guilty? Men will mostly define rape in terms, where force and sexual desire are a total package. Here, the law’s problem becomes distinguishing rape from acts misconstrued by the victim as “mere sexual violation” in specific cases. Is it any wonder, then, that most raped women feel that the revised law against rape under such circumstances remains virtually unenforceable as applied to them?Law is a society’s text, its rational soul. Our courts have recently introduced commendable changes by amending some laws and de-recognising a few colonial ones. Should they now really wish to reflect upon the issue of the sexual exploitation of women, they must acknowledge how much the legitimacy of much of our laws has been derived by force and at women’s expense."

			In Iran, illegally brewed alcohol has killed 42, blinded dozens, landed hundreds in hospital		",New York Times,New York Times,"It was not clear what was in the concoctions. In the past, authorities have blamed high levels of methanol — a simple alcohol used as an antifreeze and for biofuels — for contaminating drinks.Poisonous batches of bootleg alcohol have killed at least 42 people, blinded more than a dozen others and sent hundreds to the hospital across Iran in recent weeks, the country’s Health Ministry said.The police are said to have raided at least one underground distillery and arrested dozens of people in connection with the tainted drinks. The youngest victim was a 19-year-old woman, the BBC reported.It was not clear what was in the concoctions. In the past, authorities have blamed high levels of methanol — a simple alcohol used as an antifreeze and for biofuels — for contaminating drinks.The deaths come several years into a government effort to begin acknowledging Iran’s drinking problem and to provide treatment for addiction. Taboo for devout Muslims, alcohol has been illegal in Iran since the 1979 revolution, and those caught consuming it can be punished with a lashing.But smuggled and homemade liquor is widely available, with alcohol suppliers making deliveries to people’s doorsteps.Dozens of people die from alcohol poisoning every year in Iran, but the death toll in recent weeks was unusually high. The poisonings spread from provinces in northeastern Iran and near Tehran to the southern coast.A steep drop in the value of Iran’s currency since the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal has driven up the price of imported items. That may be making it more difficult for Iranians to purchase smuggled foreign alcohol, which could in turn be steering them to homemade liquor.Iran’s drinking culture was pushed into the shadows for many years by a government peddling the official line that no one drank. But reality eventually intruded, making plain that Iran, like many other nations, has an alcohol problem. Official statistics show that at least 10 percent of the population uses alcohol.Now dozens of private clinics and government institutions have opened help desks and special wards for alcoholics. The government has allowed a large and growing network of Alcoholics Anonymous groups, modeled after those in the United States. And the government has tried to combat drunken driving by giving officers breathalyzers and running public campaigns about the dangers.In the last three weeks, at least 16 people went blind and 170 others were forced to undergo dialysis after drinking the bootleg alcohol, the government said. In all, 460 people were hospitalized."

			Delhi HC pulls up IAF for confining officer to psychiatric ward		",Express News Service,Express News Service,"The bench said the newly-enacted Mental Healthcare Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent.The Delhi High Court Thursday pulled up the Indian Air Force (IAF) for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, over claims of him being an alcoholic and suffering from mental disorders. Terming the act of the IAF “irresponsible”, a bench of Justice S Muralidhar and Justice Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF’s decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still “craved for alcohol”.“How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there,” said the bench.The court’s observations were made while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal’s father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital. Central government standing counsel Ripudaman Bhardwaj, appearing for the IAF, contended that action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.He also submitted that the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital, and thereafter, in June, was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.The bench, however, said that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person’s liberty as “short of chaining him up, everything else was done here”. It directed that the corporal be produced in court Friday. It also said the newly-enacted Mental Healthcare Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent. “The IAF cannot ignore the laws of the country,” the bench remarked.“This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Healthcare Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,” added the bench. It said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of “Alcoholics Anonymous” on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases."

			Mission Impossible actor Simon Pegg calls his struggle with alcohol ‘awful’		",PTI,PTI,"Mission Impossible actor Simon Pegg said when he returned to the UK, his home, he went into rehab which helped him turn his life around.Actor Simon Pegg has opened up about his struggle with depression and alcoholism, saying that he checked into a rehabilitation centre to seek recovery. The 48-year-old actor said while he was shooting Mission: Impossible III in 2006, he was “fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic”.“It was awful, terrible,” he told The Guardian while talking about his struggle. “It owned me.”Pegg said his depression did not allow him to enjoy the experience of working with the likes of Tom Cruise on the Mission: Impossible films and J.J. Abrams on the Star Trek reboot.“I would feel like — I’m in a film with Tom Cruise, I’ve got the part of Scotty in Star Trek”, he told the publication. “This should be making me feel happy. But it wasn’t.”“When I watch that film back, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic,” Pegg added.The actor said he “micro-managed” his condition for quite some time, till the ball dropped.“One thing (addiction) does is make you clever at not giving anything away. People think junkies and alcoholics are slovenly, unmotivated people. They’re not – they are incredibly organised. They can nip out for a quick shot of whisky and you wouldn’t know they have gone. It’s as if … you are micro-managed by it,” Pegg said.“But eventually the signs are too obvious. You have taken the dog for one too many walks,” he added.Pegg revealed that while he was on a trip to Comic-Con to promote his 2011 movie Paul, he went missing for four days.The actor said when he returned to the UK, his home, he went into rehab which helped him turn his life around.“I got into it. I got into the reasons I was feeling that way. I went into AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) for a while, too. I don’t think I would be here now if I hadn’t had help,” he said."

			To contain suicides, BSF plans annual mental health tests		",Deeptiman Tiwary,New Delhi | ,"Based on how they fare in the test, soldiers will be assigned duties and corrective measures taken. Until now only annual physical tests were held to see if soldiers were fit to discharge their duties.TRYING to contain suicides among paramilitary forces, the BSF has made it mandatory for all its personnel to undergo an annual test to determine their mental health. Based on how they fare in the test, soldiers will be assigned duties and corrective measures taken. Until now only annual physical tests were held to see if soldiers were fit to discharge their duties.The BSF has also come up with a broad set of guidelines on ensuring recreational time for soldiers, holding periodic meetings on the pattern of Alcoholics Anonymous where they can share personal stories, mandatory interviews for all those returning from leave, and an informal mechanism to address grievances.The steps follow year-long research, where the force studied the pattern of suicides by its personnel and analysed the reasons for the same. Two hundred BSF medics were then trained in clinical psychology in consultation with psychiatrists from London to conduct the tests to determine mental health of jawans. The programme is being called ‘Holistic Well-Being Intervention’ so as to avoid stigma related to mental illness. Read | Death of a jawanOfficials said their research showed that suicides were higher among personnel from poor socio-economic background, and mostly among the 25-35 age group. However, there was not much difference in suicide rates when it came to the marital status of personnel or whether they belonged to nuclear or joint families.“Poor motivation, alcohol dependency, sleep disorders, problems with spouse or other relatives at home, unfavourable working conditions, financial issues, anger and helplessness” were identified as factors leading to stress and depression and eventually suicides.Inspector General Satwant Atwal Trivedi, who has been a student of clinical psychology and oversaw the project, said, “Suicides anywhere are tragic, but when a trained soldier commits it, it’s loss of a national asset. We want to do our best and provide the best possible environment and care to ensure our soldiers do not take the extreme step. Until now, the healthcare routine in the forces was not too focused on mental well-being. We believe if problems are recognised early and taken care of, tragedies can be averted.”BSF sources said the suicide research was an eye-opener in how many myths it broke. “It has often been argued that marital discords lead to suicides, but data shows that the share of single men and married individuals was equal. Nuclear families are also blamed often, but the research revealed that 51 per cent of the victims were from nuclear families and 49 per cent from joint,” an officer said.About their findings regarding the age of the suicide victims, and their financial background, a psychologist associated with the programme said, “Our understanding is that the magnitude of our struggles with finances, family issues or work-related stress is higher when one is young. With the passage of time, one learns to adjust with one’s situation. It is in this period that these vulnerable individuals need to be spotted and taken care of.”As part of the research, officials took up case studies, such as going through the diary of a soldier who had committed suicide. While by all accounts, he was appreciated at his job, and had no family issues or responsibilities, an official said the diary showed otherwise. “We found he was terribly lonely. He came from a broken family and was raised by his maternal uncle who gave him a lot of love, but his uncle’s wife was not that affectionate. He had written that he was very happy when his sister got married into a good family, but that he now felt alone. He also felt he was not made for the job, but recognised that he wouldn’t get a better job.”In the case of a cook on sentry duty, the research showed that he was uncomfortable carrying a gun, and the stress led him to kill himself.“These are cases where the signs are so subtle that a company commander would never spot it unless trained in clinical psychology. That is why the quetionnaire we have prepared has some very simple questions such as ‘How are you feeling today’, ‘Are you sleeping well these days’, to gauge whether a person is leading a normal life or not,” a psychologist said.Field units will soon be issued booklets containing the string of guidelines to help destress soldiers, including group games, and good diet and proper healthcare. Among the additions is asking commanders to ensure their “troops get time for recreation and that facilities (games, TV, movies and books) are available”. Commanders are also being asked to ensure that grievances are addressed by them informally as the formal channel takes too long and frustrates the personnel.Units are being asked to create mutual-aid fellowship groups and organise sessions — called ‘Ghar Ki Baat’ — where personnel will talk about their problems and experiences."

			Alcoholics Anonymous founding document sells for $2.4 million		",AP,AP,"He says he attempted to buy the manuscript when it was up for auction several years ago, and he is thrilled at the opportunity to share it publicly.The founding document of Alcoholics Anonymous, known to adherents as the ‘Big Book,’ sold at auction Saturday for $2.4 million to billionaire and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. The auction house Profiles in History announced the sale of the manuscript with handwritten notes from the group’s founding fathers.Irsay told The Associated Press he plans to build a special display for the manuscript and display it for several months a year at Alcoholics Anonymous’ headquarters in New York.

			Alcoholics Anonymous founding document sells for $2.4 million		",AP,AP,"He says he attempted to buy the manuscript when it was up for auction several years ago, and he is thrilled at the opportunity to share it publicly.The founding document of Alcoholics Anonymous, known to adherents as the ‘Big Book,’ sold at auction Saturday for $2.4 million to billionaire and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. The auction house Profiles in History announced the sale of the manuscript with handwritten notes from the group’s founding fathers.Irsay told The Associated Press he plans to build a special display for the manuscript and display it for several months a year at Alcoholics Anonymous’ headquarters in New York. He says he attempted to buy the manuscript when it was up for auction several years ago, and he is thrilled at the opportunity to share it publicly.Irsay said he considers himself a steward for the manuscript, which he said he may also send out on tour so it can be seen by more people. “I’ve held it.

			The great bank fiddle		",Manish Sabharwal,04 am,"Bankers’ demands for accounting forbearance are dangerous and self-serving.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel warned, “it is a folly to ignore realities; facts take their revenge if they are not faced squarely and well”. India’s banking crisis, a child of many parents, is surely part revenge for a multi-decade disastrous policy of regulatory forbearance in bad loan accounting. The sustained campaign by bankers and defaulters for extending this nonsense yielded results over the last few weeks, with a one-year deferral of Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS) and dilution of provisions for loans to companies in bankruptcy. This sustained campaign by bankers and defaulters — peaking in the parliamentary panel presentation last week — against the February 12 RBI circular that atones for the RBI’s past sins is shameful, dangerous and self-serving.Shameful: Two sets of accounting books — real and reported — created India’s curse of informality where only 7 million of 63 million enterprises were registered for indirect taxes before GST and only 1.5 per cent of our 1.2 billion citizens paid income tax before demonetisation. Both are up over 50 per cent over the last 24 months. Bankers pushing for accounting forbearance seem to believe that investors and the public are fools who only focus on de jeure (what they report) rather than de facto (what their reality is). India’s poverty is partly a child of our sense of humour about the rule of law; an entrepreneur who follows a rule feels like she missed a deal because of transmission losses between how the law is written, interpreted, practised and enforced. But sunshine is the best disinfectant; Corporate India is already live with IndAS, informality is rapidly reducing in the real economy, and banks should be at the forefront of transparency since they sell trust.Dangerous: The argument that India’s infrastructure would not be built without accounting forbearance is unverifiable at best, and nonsense at worst. Maybe a bond market would have developed. Maybe more equity would have been raised; large Indian companies with debt defaults have 50 per cent + promoter holding while great entrepreneurs like Sachin at Flipkart, Bhavish at Ola, Jeff Bezos at Amazon, and Jack Ma at Alibaba own less than 20 per cent of their companies. Maybe over-invoicing would not have happened. Maybe more foreign strategic investors would have come. Maybe EPFO would have begun infrastructure investing given its liability profile. Bank recapitalisations crowd out government spending — imagine if we could have used the last Rs 2 lakh crore in primary education, healthcare and apprenticeships. More delays in bad loan resolution will only increase recapitalisation demands.Self-serving: A telling story about banking comes from the global financial crisis: An American banker responds to his risk management colleague who questions selling a product that would surely explode in a few years with the cryptic email “IBG/YBG” (I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone). Giving money is an unskilled job; the skill lies in getting money back. There are immediate consequences of accounting profitability for banker compensation and careers but the consequences of poor decisions are so far in the future that it’s hard to hold bankers, board directors, and auditors accountable. Nicholas Taleb calls this the Bob Rubin trade in his new book Skin in the Game; heads he wins, tails he shouts Black Swan (an unforeseeable, uncontrollable and rare event). Accounting forbearance never reduces the size of the problem; it gets successors to deal with a bigger problem. Bankers and defaulters currently positioning accounting forbearance as the only alternative to an economy-wide credit drought are hardly being honest, dispassionate or fair.While the logical sequence for bad loans is revealing, recognising and resolving, India is doing it in reverse order. There is much blame to go around and the RBI cannot — and should not — escape its fair share. But the RBI has begun healing itself. The RBI forcing NCLT filings by banks kicked off a splendid process of resolving that will soon start a stream of good news for 41 big defaults; this technology should be extended to all defaulters above Rs 100 crore. India needs to introspect on banking supervision, governance and human capital — not all defaults are fraud, only a few bankers are corrupt, and Binani withdrawing its Supreme Court petition for insolvency termination last week was positive. But the first stage of Alcoholics Anonymous is acceptance; RBI’s February circular hurts evergreening, deferring and fudging for big defaults (it exempts MSME loans up to Rs 25 crore). The default response of blunting regulatory and accounting actions based on whining by defaulters and bankers needs revaluation; this whining often positions self-interest as national interest. And acting on this whining enables unskilled bankers and defaulters to punish skilled bankers and good borrowers.Governments everywhere are conflicted between their roles as custodians of financial stability, agents of growth, and shareholders of banks. Notwithstanding the nobility of past motivations, it is now clear that India’s current banking crisis is a child of multi-decade action and inaction by the RBI and the Department of Financial Services in the Ministry of Finance. Cleaning up the banking system and ending crony capitalism now needs them to march together as a team. In the next few years, we must create a public and private banking system with governance, culture and consequences. If we fail, we will all be guilty of stealing from our grandchildren because government finances cannot be on the hook forever for all bank deposits without shrinking education, health, and social security expenditure. Accounting solutions to bad loans deserve the quip that for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple, plausible and wrong. Ghalib said it better “Umar bhar Ghalib yahi bhool karta raha, dhool chehre pe thi, lekin aina saaf karta raha (All his life, Ghalib kept making the same mistake; dust was on his face but he kept cleaning the mirror)”. Fiddling with accounting (the mirror) doesn’t change reality (the dust on bank faces). Let’s end it."

			At Lajpat Nagar school, an AA meeting only for women		",Somya Lakhani,New Delhi | ,"In the classroom — apart from wooden chairs and photos of accomplished people — were posters of the group, which read: ‘Who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it stay here’.On Saturday afternoon, when Malini’s daughter sent her a text requesting her to babysit her nine-month-old for a few hours, she was filled with gratitude. “My daughter was trusting her child with me, an alcoholic. I feel like I’m becoming a parent again and my daughter is becoming my child again, instead of my caretaker,” she told an audience of 30 women, gathered at a school in Lajpat Nagar on day one of the two-day All India Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Women’s Convention.Malini has been sober for 14 years now. Over coffee and cookies, tears and laughter, women from Delhi, Bengaluru, Manipur, Meghalaya and even New Zealand shared stories of their struggles with, and triumphs over, alcoholism.From 26-year-old Devika, who has been sober for a year now, to Kamla, 74, who gave up alcohol 17 years ago; from Neelam, who looked for “the next high” even at her mother’s cremation a year ago, to 37-year-old Megha who gave up alcohol and substances after a bad business call — the room was teeming with stories of survival.In the classroom — apart from wooden chairs and photos of accomplished people — were posters of the group, which read: ‘Who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it stay here’.The day began with a ‘serenity prayer’, and was followed with panel discussions on “disease and recovery” and “creating awareness about AA for women”.“Male and female alcoholics are similar but also very different. The difference lies in how secretive it is in the case of women. The shame and guilt is higher if it’s a woman — and the answer is patriarchy. That it’s hidden means fewer women will get help or reach out for help,” a participant said.For 29-year-old Natasha, who has now been sober for six years, the toughest bit was going back to the same office where she was caught drinking. “That environment was difficult; people made cheeky comments and whatnot. When a man drinks, he is macho; when a woman does it, she is promiscuous. This means many drink secretly, and their families don’t get them help,” Natasha, who took to alcohol and substance abuse at 17 and is now a sponsor (mentor) to a woman alcoholic, said.Megha, 37, who works in the fashion industry, spoke about the “normalisation of alcohol and drug abuse in peer circles”. “Many in our generation don’t acknowledge they are alcoholics… Ever since I quit, some of my friends tell me I have become boring. But I am at peace with myself, so it’s all good,” she said."

			Clandestine sex industry booms in Rohingya refugee camps		",Reuters,Reuters,"Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade.As Rohingya women struggle to access even the very basics such as food and water in Bangladesh’s overcrowded camps, a flourishing sex trade offers cash in times of desperation. Four women entered the clean-swept mud hut, took off their black shawls and sat cross-legged on the floor. When asked if they sold sex, the women stirred uncomfortably and were silent. Later, after cups of tea, the question came up again. The women caught each other’s eyes. Slowly one of them walked across the room to shut the door, another blocked the window. Darkness fell in the small, humid hut and voices turned to whispers.“If anyone finds out what we do, they will kill us,” murmured 26-year-old Romida. More than 600,000 ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, have fled attacks by the Myanmar army since late August, fleeing across to border to southern Bangladesh in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. In Kutupalong, the biggest camp, the sex industry is thriving. Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade.“At least 500 Rohingya prostitutes live in Kutupalong,” said Noor, who works as a fixer, but many have lived for years in the camp which was established in 1992. “Recruiters now have their eyes set on the newcomers,” she added. UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public.“It’s hard to come by numbers and we don’t collect data on how many sex workers are in the camps,” Saba Zariv, an expert on gender-based violence at the U.N.’s population agency UNFPA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RUMOURSA recent report from UNICEF, the U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF report said that in the chaotic, unorganised camps, children and youths could fall prey to traffickers and people looking to exploit and manipulate them. From tight-knit conservative Muslim communities, the Rohingya often turn a blind eye to prostitution. “People pretend that it doesn’t exist,” said Noor. “The girls meet their Bangladeshi clients outside the camps. They don’t sleep with other Rohingya. Our communities are tight and rumours could spread easily. Each girl wants to appear pure.”Many of the prostitutes are children who eat no more than one meal a day and don’t attend school. They work secretively without even their parents knowing. Rena, 18, who has lived in the camp for the past decade was forced to marry an alcoholic two years ago. “He mistreated me and beat me,” she said. Her abusive husband ran left her when she gave birth to her first son. Feeding her child became impossible.“That’s when I decided to become a sex worker. I was only 16, but it was out of desperation. I needed money.” Fourteen-year-old Kamru, who also sells sex, arrived years ago in a previous wave of Rohingya refugees. She has never been able to attend school because her family is too poor. “The camp is all I remember. I grew up here, but I was always hungry,” said the teenager, who like all the women and girls did not want to reveal her full name.Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry. “If aid agencies can’t manage to provide people with their basic needs, the risk of trafficking grows – if we can’t establish a sustainable mechanism here and aid tires out, we could see trafficking levels rise,” said Lisa Akero, gender protection specialist at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).SLIPPING INTO PROSTITUTIONRomida had been left hungry and malnourished and saw prostitution as the only way she could survive. “I told myself I’d do anything. I didn’t have a choice.” Her first client was a Bangladeshi friend who convinced her to have sex with him for 1,000 Taka ($12).“He paid good money,” she recalled. “The going-rate is 200 ($2.50) and my fixer takes half of it.” The business largely operates by phone calls, with pimps informing the girls where to go and who to see. On average, Romida has three male clients a week – and daren’t risk taking on more for fear of being found out. “I sometimes travel as far as Cox’s Bazar city, which is a two hour drive. Whenever I leave the camp, I have to make up excuses. I pretend to be visiting relatives or taking a shift at the market.”The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds – from university students to local politicians. In a brief phone conversation, Ali, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi student told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he sleeps with prostitutes occasionally, but when he eventually marries he would expect his wife to be a virgin.Most clients don’t use condoms, the women said. “I take birth control injections, but I worry about HIV every day,” said Romida. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases.SAFE SPACESHalf an hour’s drive away from the muddy, chaotic camps, surrounded by green rice paddies, local charity Pulse has set up a safe house for refugees that can host up to 30 women. Due to open in the coming days, the dormitory-style apartment is newly refurbished and has a psychologist on site.“The girls who come here might not want to talk about what is happening in their lives as they could be in danger,” said the shelter’s manager Kurshida Aktar, adding that all vulnerable women are welcome: victims of rape, single mothers and sex workers.“We’re creating an opportunity for women to rebuild their lives, access basic needs, have an outlet to talk and receive job training,” said Aktar. But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak to the Thomson Reuters Foundation were largely unaware of such services. “We don’t ask about it for fear of being found out,” said Kamru, the youngest of the girls.As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. “I have to take it off when I’m with my Bangladeshi clients,” she said. “But in the camp it’s my way to stay anonymous.”"

But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak to the Thomson Reuters Foundation were largely unaware of such services. “We don’t ask about it for fear of being found out,” said Kamru, the youngest of the girls.As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. “I have to take it off when I’m with my Bangladeshi clients,” she said. “But in the camp it’s my way to stay anonymous.”"

Bedi said he is taking his work forward along with Father Pereira.A BOOK aimed at shedding light on the psychological and spiritual origins of substance addiction, The Spiritual Paradox of Addiction, was launched at the Mumbai Press Club on Monday. The book is by Dr Ashok Bedi, a Jungian psychoanalyst, co-authored by Father Joseph Pereira, who started the first Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) through his parish in Mumbai and also started the Kripa Foundation that aims to help alcoholics recover.“There is no chemical solution for a chemical dependency.

			The Heart Goes Last		",Paromita Chakrabarti,29 pm,"A haunting collection of short stories that navigate the complex landscape of human relationships among Indians at home and in the USBook Name: A Life of Adventure and DelightAuthor: Akhil SharmaPublisher: PenguinPages: 190 pagesPrice: Rs 599“A life of adventure and delight” indicates a journey of discovery and promise, a life in which self-actualisation comes in unexpectedly fulfilling ways. And so, the title of Akhil Sharma’s first collection of short stories comes across as an invite — both provocative and ironic — to explore how this journey plays out in the lives of his very ordinary cast of characters. A retired, lonely immigrant in New Jersey tries to forge a relationship with his American neighbour when his wife leaves him unexpectedly after 30 years of marriage to seek spiritual salvation; a gawky, overweight, second generation immigrant confesses that he has always been in love — first, with Wonder Woman and Mary Jane, Spiderman’s girlfriend, and, now, with an athletic American colleague, who lets him get his way with her even though she doesn’t like him very much; a young boy in India grows up loathing a self-serving distant relative, but can never make his disgust known because he does not have the “courage to take revenge”; in the titular story, a PhD student in the Bronx finds greater thrill in courting prostitutes than in getting pinned to a life of familiar domesticity that his upbringing demands of him. There’s also a brief version of Sharma’s semi-autobiographical second novel, Family Life, the story of an Indian family in America devastated by a freak accident that leaves its eldest child comatose.None of the eight stories in the collection come with happily ever-afters. In fact, they are caught up in the abiding anxieties of immigrant life and the chaos of life at home, where reality and aspirations are at perpetual odds. Sharma brings out the extraordinary anguish of everyday lives with remarkable directness and a quiet empathy, the kind we reserve for those familiar to us, even if we don’t always know them very well. His prose is spare but lambent, gentle yet unsentimental. The men who populate Sharma’s short stories are deeply flawed, complex creatures, often selfish and self-obsessed, their characters shaped by prejudices that limit the growth arc of their personalities. In ‘A Heart is Such a Heavy Thing’, an overbearing patriarch finds himself relegated to the margins of family life after the marriage of his eldest son. In ‘You are Happy’, an alcoholic mother is murdered by her family, leaving her young son to grapple with the unfairness of life: “It seemed awful that his mother had died, that his father seemed to have forgotten her, that this woman was still living her life.” But Sharma does not turn the book into a morality tale or an ethnographic exploration, even though some of the lighter moments in the book arise from the latter. Instead, he anchors his characters in the lives they have designed for themselves and the circumstances they are caught in, viewing their foibles with a wry disengagement.My favourite story comes midway through the collection, the only one in which Sharma writes from a female perspective. ‘If You Sing Like That For Me’ is the story of Anita’s brief, desperate attempt to love the husband her parents had arranged for her. Unlike her male counterparts, Anita, and, to some degree, the other shadowy female protagonists who hover in the periphery of this collection, have greater success at distilling their emotions and putting their lives in perspective. “I was neither pretty nor talented, and my family was not rich. But I could not imagine spending my life with someone so anonymous… If asked, I would have been unable to tell what kind of man I wanted to marry, whether he should be handsome and funny. I was not even certain I wanted to marry, though at times I thought marriage would make me less lonely. What I wanted was to be with someone who could make me different, someone other than the person I was,” says Anita. Her husband, we know from the onset, is not going to be that person. Towards the end of the story, after a night of desperate lovemaking, the unfailingly polite Rajinder confides in her that the secret of his success lay in pragmatic compromise: “I had at least wanted an MA, and someone who worked, but Mummy didn’t approve of a daughter-in-law who worked. I was willing to change my requirements.”To find adventure and delight in the stolid and the squalid is a challenge not everyone is up for. In this achingly beautiful collection of stories, Sharma explores, with great poignancy, all the things that hold us together or bring us down on our knees in our search for fulfillment."

Both are just out of a relationship, sort of at the crossroads in their life. Love. How do we define this word? We love our family. We love food. We love the weather. We love our shoes. Love that music. Love someone’s work. Love a movie. Love a celebrity. Love that time in life. Love love love! Out of the 28 definitions my dictionary suggests, it mostly means to feel warm, passionate affection towards something, usually a person.But what about applying this word for relationships in today’s world? To feel a warm passionate affection towards somebody. An unconditional feeling for that one special person, that is selfish yet compassionate. With a new stress we deal with every day; pressures from families, work, career, our own self, is it really possible to penetrate the surface and feel something deeper than just a casual liking for someone?This week my recommendation is Netflix original unromantic comedy series LOVE.Logline: Rebellion Mickey and good-natured Gus navigate the thrills and agonies of modern relationships in this bold comedy series, created by Judd Apatow.Warning: rated 18+. Contains language and sex.The series is spread across two seasons of a total of twenty two episodes, ten in the first season and twelve in second and is set in Los Angeles, California, USA. Love’s prime characters Gus (Paul Rust – also the co-creator and executive producer of the show) and Mickey (Gillian Jacobs) live and work in LA in the media industry. Gus is a child star tutor on the shooting sets of a hated television show Witchita, handling the crew and the child star (and her parents’) tantrums and trying very hard to pitch himself as a writer. Just out of a relationship, Gus moves out of his girlfriend’s house and starts his life anew at a Hollywood apartment making friends with the very friendly neighbours who drop by to his house to sing improvised songs for movies that don’t have a title score. The amiable and welcoming Gus gets along with most people who cross his path.The annoying yet gorgeous and hardworking Mickey is out of yet another relationship, and this time she is done with guys with piercings, tattoos and drug habits. Being a love, sex, alcohol and drug addict, she tries to attend as many AA (alcoholics anonymous) meetings, making new promises to herself to quit her vices. Mickey works at a radio station as a manager, heading the show of Dr. Greg, who solves love and relationship problems of his callers, but in reality, has a rather desperate personality.When the messed-up Mickey and friendly Gus meet, they hit it off. Initially hanging out just as friends, Mickey hooks him up with her roommate Bertie with thick Australian accent, which fizzles out immediately. Eventually, Mickey herself ends up liking Gus. Gus, who liked Mickey from the beginning but thought she was too cool for him, becomes her support system. The first season transforms their friendship to little-more-than-friends-but-not-a-couple and the second season is their journey of becoming a couple.The show is shot very well. Directed by various directors, yet it is well executed. Written fabulously and performed at par by all the actors. The biggest take away from the show is its well-crafted characters and the episode flow. The show is rated 7.7 on the IMDB and 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.Love is the perfect binge watch series for the weekend.

			Trailing Memories		",Surbhi Gupta,57 am,"Sudha Murty, author and Infosys Foundation Chairperson on her latest book, Three Thousand Stitches, and why she will not write an autobiography.Sudha Murty regularly receives postcards from her readers asking for a job at Infosys. She doesn’t mind really — she’d written one herself once upon a time. She was the first woman engineer to be hired by Tata Motors (then TELCO) after she wrote to JRD Tata against their policy of hiring only males. In Three Thousand Stitches (Penguin, Rs 250), her latest non-fiction book, Murty shares her ordeal of being the first and the only girl student at the BVB College of Engineering and Technology in Karnataka’s Hubli, her hometown. “I cried after writing that story. I don’t know how I could do that at that point in life. But the fact that I did not have a toilet for four years in the college motivated me to build 13,000 toilets in the state,” says Murty, who spearheads the Infosys Foundation.The first story in Three Thousand Stitches is about the journey of Murty’s first social service project — ending temple prostitution in Karnataka. “Such unusual experiences happen once in a lifetime and they may not happen with everyone. I was overwhelmed while speaking about the devadasis at the book launch in Bengaluru. Social service is not as easy as it is considered to be; one has to keep personal ambitions behind and work for the people,” she says.A collection of 11 stories based on real life incidents, the book narrates Murty’s experiences and encounters from her youth, family, work at the foundation and her travels. “Experiences happen and I keep them in my mind. They remain with me for a long time but the actual process of writing can take just a few days,” she says.Interesting encounters happen everyday, but Murty says she does not find the need to maintain a daily journal. “To be a good writer, observation is key. I work with so many people on a daily basis and experiences keep on happening,” she said. The stories in the book have a long and varied timeline — her trip to Uzbekistan that happened two months before she started writing, the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting she had attended six months before, and the story about her doctor father’s patient that took place almost 75 years ago.For a young Murty, storytelling was never the plan. “My mother, a schoolteacher, used to tell us to write essays on our picnics or trips. I never thought I would tell stories one day. I’m not a great writer like others. Perhaps, I’m a writer for the common man,” says Murty, who adds that she will not write an autobiography. “I consider myself a very ordinary person. There is nothing that people can learn from me. It is only the situations that made me what I am today. Readers have already got a glimpse into my life through the non-fiction books I’ve written,” she says."

			All-women crew at Matunga station: Safety and infrastructure issues emerge		",Written by Kajol Runwal | ,Mumbai | ,"While some of the women are unhappy about having been transferred without being asked, others cite the late-night shifts, the unsuitable environment around the station and safety issues.WHILE railway officials and passengers unanimously welcomed the concept of an all-women crew for a suburban railway station when it was inaugurated at Matunga earlier this month, a series of practical problems and complaints from women employees posted at the station have somewhat dulled the sheen on Central Railway’s unique idea for women empowerment.The pilot project of an all-women crew, initiated on June 5, involved posting a 30-strong team at the station, comprising 14 booking clerks, two RPF personnel, four pointspersons, seven ticket checkers, two announcers and a station manager, all women. Three weeks later, the practical challenges have begun to emerge.“I live in Titwala and before being transferred here, I worked at Shahad station. I was posted to Matunga without being asked,” said one announcer at the station, adding that she suffers from a vision problem and can only see with one eye. “Travelling so far late in the night is very difficult for me,” she added.While almost all of the 30 women candidly expressed their grievances, they chose to remain anonymous, fearing an adverse reaction from superiors for complaining about the initiative. While some of the women are unhappy about having been transferred without being asked, others cite the late-night shifts, the unsuitable environment around the station and safety issues.“Our night duty begins at 11 pm and ends at 8 am. This is the time when there are drug-addicts and alcoholics loitering in and around the railway station,” said one woman RPF personnel. She added that Matunga station is in close proximity to slum pockets and unsavoury elements roam freely around the area. “We are apprehensive about stepping on to the tracks to perform our duty in case an emergency chain is pulled or if there is an accident, because we are petrified of the dangers in the dark,” she added. In one incident, when a passenger had to be rushed to hospital, four male passengers had to be requested to help lift the stretcher.A ticket-booking clerk said she has experienced misbehavior and eve-teasing incidents at the booking windows. “Vulgar men hover around the counters, staring lewdly,” she said. “As word spreads that there are only women at this station, the number of such men will increase.”There are infrastructural problems too. “The toilet is outside, near the tracks, and there is no space for workers to take shelter at night after the trains stop,” said the ticket checker.Station manager Mamta Kulkarni said Central Railway is working on building an indoor toilet, expected to be ready in a month’s time.Following requests from the RPF women, two male constables have been appointed at the Matunga station at night, for improved security.Despite the hindrances, Kulkarni said she is committed to run the station efficiently and hopes to counsel her team regularly in order to keep them motivated.Asked about the women’s problems, senior Public Relations Officer A K Jain said the initiative had been taken for women empowerment, at the behest of General Manager D K Sharma. “I have personally visited the station to ask the staff about their issues. As a start, we have deployed two male constables to guard the staff for security and are working towards building a toilet inside the station. We will address more of their concerns in the near future. As this is a novel initiative towards women empowerment by the railways, it must be encouraged,” said Ravinder Goyal, Divisional Railway Manager, CR."

			How I escaped an X-rated life: A 56-year-old woman on moving court and asking for porn websites to be blocked		",Written by Dipti Nagpaul D'souza | ,05 am,"The story of her life and marriage, wrecked by violence and abuse, is her strongest argument.“He will kill you.” Her daughter’s words had jolted her. Lying in the hospital two years ago, with a broken hand recently operated on, Lata Agarwal (name changed) was compelled to rethink the 33 years she had given to her marriage. None of what her daughter said was new to Agarwal — she had been aware of the danger in continuing to live with her husband, a violent man addicted to pornography. This was the fourth time the abusive relationship had landed her in hospital. She had believed she ought to save the marriage for the sake of her children. But her daughter told her she had done more damage. “I had spent all my energies trying to deal with my marriage, with no time left to focus on them. They had grown up without me,” she says.Seated in a coffee shop in a Mumbai suburb, Agarwal looks like any professional woman in her 50s. She is tall, and the slim trousers she has paired with a blue shirt adds to her height. Throughout the conversation, her body language is confident, her voice steady, even when she speaks of her abuse. She says she has regained her confidence since she separated from her husband two years ago. In this time, the 56-year-old has trained as a counsellor for women facing domestic abuse, completed a postgraduate diploma in business management, and gone to court against what she believes ruined her life — pornography.Earlier this year, Agarwal filed a petition in the Supreme Court, in support of a petition filed four years ago by Indore-based lawyer Kamlesh Vaswani, asking for restrictions on pornographic websites. “Porn destroyed my life. Through the women I meet as a counsellor, I have come to realise I am not alone. This is very common. It needs addressing so that more women and families don’t suffer like me,” she says.Agarwal meanders while recounting the complicated story of how she — an educated and once financially independent woman — got here. Education, she says with a cynical laugh, is of little help “if one is plain foolish”. “Look at me. A chemical engineer from Roorkee College of Engineering, which is today an IIT. What did I do with my life?” It took immense effort for her to speak up and share her story. “It meant revisiting the pain and humiliation of over three decades…” she says, glancing at her wrist that bears the scars of surgery, “But I will try.”The sexual abuse began early, Agarwal says, thinking back to 1985, the year of her marriage. “I was initially surprised that my husband would find the need to flip through Playboy magazines every day, or watch a porn movie. I asked a few friends and was told it’s common for men to do that, so I kept quiet,” she says. But when some months later, the sexual demands made by her husband escalated, she was taken aback.“He wanted more sex and he wanted things acted out that I wasn’t comfortable with,” she says. Initially, she made some compromises, played along. But over time, his sexual appetite increased. Each refusal was met with physical abuse, often in an intoxicated state. The assaults persisted outside the bedroom as well. “A disagreement, something not done to his liking, any protest, led to a slap, tugging at my hair, throwing things around,” she says.Agarwal knew she ought to protest, but hadn’t she also grown up around violence? “I had watched my mother suffer abuse at the hands of my father. Patriarchy seemed common, even normal, in the small town in Uttar Pradesh where I was born and brought up,” she says. A bright student, she scored well throughout school, but while her father often discussed a possible career in engineering for her brothers, her future was never considered.One day, a friend of her brother was visiting and he had a spare application form for the Roorkee College of Engineering. She sent her application through him. In a few weeks, she received an acceptance letter from the college, but her father refused to let her join. “My elder sister is 16 years older. Her husband insisted that I study. My traditional father, unable to refuse his son-in-law, was left with no choice,” she says.It was after college, in the initial months of working, that Agarwal met Amit through common friends. He was charming and persistent. But she was hesitant to marry at all, after having seen her mother suffer. Eventually, she agreed. After a brief courtship, they made their love official, and got married. Everything seemed normal and happy, he was attentive and caring, and the first few weeks passed blissfully.Her son was six when she first attempted suicide.Amit had already made her quit her job at a prominent company within months of their marriage. “His porn addiction and what was going on within the walls of our bedroom was too embarrassing to discuss with anyone,” she says. She had no financial backup, no support from her parents, and her in-laws insisted that she needed to be a coy, subservient wife and do more to not attract his wrath.When she woke up in the hospital after the first attempt, her in-laws coerced her into telling the police that it was an accident. She had consumed poison by mistake.A daughter was born soon after, yet another attempt to make the husband “fall in line”, as suggested by well-wishers. But what followed instead was more emotional abuse. “It was clear that he was now seeking pleasure outside the marriage. When my house help complained that he had made a move on her, I dismissed it. Surely, he wouldn’t fancy her,” she says. Only years later, the whispers of acquaintances and relatives confirmed the allegation.In a hall in Delhi’s Vasant Vihar neighbourhood, a bunch of men meet every Monday evening. While the India chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous has seen close to 200 participants from all over India in the two years since it started, only close to 15 have been regular. Sameer Dhar (name changed), who started the India chapter, explains that sex and porn addiction cannot be cured, only managed. “It’s a long, long process, and a tough one to manage because it’s an extension of an otherwise normal human instinct,” he says. People rarely understand the shame and the loneliness that the addict undergoes, he says. As his regular family life begins to deteriorate, an addict is plunged into isolation.Quoting from the 12-step programme of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dhar says, milder substances like beer are considered the gateway to addiction. “Similarly, in most cases, it begins with watching soft pornography and goes on to its more violent or explicit versions, which one then attempts to emulate in the bedroom,” says Dhar, who believes that porn glorifies the objectification, subjugation and exploitation of women.Rajat Mehta (name changed)’s addiction started when he was all of 10, more as a reward mechanism — he would masturbate when he did something good. “Later, porn affected my perception of what sex in real life might be. It is a distorted view. What you see in porn is not real, especially the women. So when you see real women, you may not be attracted. What you want is the photoshopped image of the websites. If your wife is loving or caring, she might agree to certain things, but she won’t be happy about it. You force these things on her because you are in a position of power. What you’re left with is resentment and anger,” says Mehta, now in his 60s. When his wife refused, he resorted to paid sex. Mehta would live with the condition for five decades before seeking help. “After retirement, I didn’t have the money to pay for sex and my health was suffering. That’s what pushed me to join SAA,” he says.Mumbai-based sexologist Rajan Bhonsle cites the example of a young lawyer, now in rehab. “He inherited a law firm and was doing very well. But he was addicted to the extent that he would skip hearings and meetings, and spend time in a library, watching porn on his phone or laptop. This continued till he lost out on business and his relationship with his wife began to deteriorate,” he says.Porn or sex addiction is often tied up with other substance abuse, such as alcohol or drugs. The tendency to inflict sexual and physical violence on partners is common in addicts, says Bhonsle.After the December 16 gangrape of a 23-year-old in Delhi, Vaswani had moved the Supreme Court asking it to block porn websites. The accused had reportedly watched porn for hours before they assaulted the woman with unspeakable brutality. “I decided to support him because I know how long and continuous exposure to porn can alter a person,” says Agarwal. While the petition supports Vaswani’s argument, Agarwal is not seeking any relief.In 2015, Vaswani succeeded in getting the apex court to pass an interim order blocking 857 porn websites. The order was revoked after five days. A 16-year-old from Kota has also filed an additional petition, citing cases of his friends addicted to porn. Now Vaswani awaits the execution of the final order, passed in February last year, which was in their favour. “A lobby of telecom companies benefit from pornography viewing,” says Vaswani, who points out that it is a crime under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code.Not everyone believes that banning porn is a solution. “I’d say no,” says a recovering addict and a member of SAA. “A ban won’t help at all. Look at how they try to curb alcohol sale. Similarly, it’s not going to change anything,” he says.Those who oppose a ban on porn argue that it is dangerous to allow the law/state into the bedroom. Bhonsle, who consults in sex and porn addiction cases, points out that triggers are everywhere, including item numbers and pop-up windows while browsing on a completely innocent subject. “Porn has been around even before internet came about. And those who desired it managed to source it back then too,” he says. He agrees, however, that the easy availability via the internet makes it worse.According to lawyer Nandita Saikia, if the dissemination of pornography is to be legal, there are questions about how that legality should be structured so that it does not become legal to disseminate explicit content which has been either filmed or disseminated without the consent of those who feature in it.“There are, in theory, already safeguards in place relating to child pornography, but there are no safeguards worth mentioning targeting non-consensual adult pornography, whether in terms of revenge porn (with disgruntled former partners disseminating explicit images), trophy porn (with rapists filming and disseminating rape), or other forms of non-consensual porn,” she writes in a blog. Saikia also points out that the talk about pornography in Indian public discourse revolves around the consumers. “There is almost no recognition worth mentioning of the rights of those who appear in pornography.”Agarwal and Vaswani argue that even if a ban has no major upside, it may curb the frequency with which people are turning into addicts. “It’s freely available now, children have access to it. By not banning it, we are making more children vulnerable to the addiction,” says Agarwal. Dhar supports the view as most cases of sex and porn addiction begin at an early age.Years passed, the children grew up but Amit’s sexual escapades became more rampant. He was no longer trying to hide his liaisons. He broke her hand once because she was trying to stop him from forcing himself on her. Soon after, he threatened divorce. “The police had landed up at our house and this time, too, I had covered up for him. He then proposed that I allow the other woman to come home freely, let them use our bedroom. He thought I would not refuse because I loved him too much,” she says . To his surprise, she drew a line and said no.For a month after he left her, Agarwal could not sleep. She says she still misses him. “It was 33 years of marriage, after all, which gave me two beautiful children. We haven’t had a single meal together as a family in the last two years,” she says.Instead, she focussed her energies on moving on and rebuilding her life. Divorce isn’t an option, she says, because the legal system takes years to resolve domestic abuse cases. “The wife in such cases is mostly bereft of a support system nor is she financially independent to pay the lawyers,” she says. Alongside counselling, Agarwal has taken up a job with an NGO in the women’s health sector and is working towards financial independence as well as a “meaningful life”. She is no longer on anti-depressants.It is the damage to her bond with her children that rankles. Both in their 20s, they are unaware of the father’s addiction. While the son knows of the petition she has filed, the daughter believes that the separation was the result of his philandering ways. “She grudges me for not being an attentive mother while he blames me for announcing that my husband is a porn addict, something he believes I have done out of spite. My son doesn’t talk to me anymore although we live in the same house. I am waiting for the day he will be willing to listen to me with an open mind,”she says.Let’s Talk About (Too Much) SexSex addiction is defined as sexually compulsive behaviour, uncontrollable even though the individual knows it has negative consequences. American psychologist Patrick Carnes, who coined the term ‘sex addiction’, said that if you’re spending over 14 hours a week doing something sexual or quasi-sexual, like cruising the internet for porn or cruising the streets looking for a particular type of prostitute, you are in the addictive range. Excessive viewing of porn is often one of the symptoms of sex addiction, but can be an independent problem as well.* In India, cases of sex/ porn addiction are mostly dealt with by sexologists.* There are limited but growing avenues to address the malaise. In Bangalore, NIMHANS’s internet de-addiction       centre also addresses porn addiction.* The India chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous started in 2014 in Delhi and is looking to expand.

			How I escaped an X-rated life: A 56-year-old woman on moving court and asking for porn websites to be blocked		",Written by Dipti Nagpaul D'souza | ,05 am,"The story of her life and marriage, wrecked by violence and abuse, is her strongest argument.“He will kill you.” Her daughter’s words had jolted her. Lying in the hospital two years ago, with a broken hand recently operated on, Lata Agarwal (name changed) was compelled to rethink the 33 years she had given to her marriage. None of what her daughter said was new to Agarwal — she had been aware of the danger in continuing to live with her husband, a violent man addicted to pornography. This was the fourth time the abusive relationship had landed her in hospital. She had believed she ought to save the marriage for the sake of her children. But her daughter told her she had done more damage. “I had spent all my energies trying to deal with my marriage, with no time left to focus on them. They had grown up without me,” she says.Seated in a coffee shop in a Mumbai suburb, Agarwal looks like any professional woman in her 50s. She is tall, and the slim trousers she has paired with a blue shirt adds to her height. Throughout the conversation, her body language is confident, her voice steady, even when she speaks of her abuse. She says she has regained her confidence since she separated from her husband two years ago. In this time, the 56-year-old has trained as a counsellor for women facing domestic abuse, completed a postgraduate diploma in business management, and gone to court against what she believes ruined her life — pornography.Earlier this year, Agarwal filed a petition in the Supreme Court, in support of a petition filed four years ago by Indore-based lawyer Kamlesh Vaswani, asking for restrictions on pornographic websites. “Porn destroyed my life.

			Bottoms up or bottle down? Highway liquor ban vs ‘jugaad’ of bars		",Jyotsna Basotia,New Delhi | ,"Even as the liquor business bears the brunt, booze ban is intended to steer the safety wheel for night travellers. “Ek daaru ki bottle dena…” was quite a common catchphrase until a few days ago, but it’s better to watch your words now. Because, if you’re found at the bar, you might as well end up behind the bars. No, we’re not kidding!Putting the “high on the way” to a dead end, the Supreme Court rolled out an order on April 1 to ban liquor sale at all bars, pubs and restaurants stationed 500m away from highways across the nation. Even as the liquor business bears the brunt, booze ban is intended to steer the safety wheel for night travellers.ALSO READ | You’ll probably think twice before having panipuri from a ‘thela’ after reading thisThe rules are set, but are they being followed? We put on our detective glasses, and hit the road to investigate. Call it funny, jugaadu or pesky, but bars and pubs have tactfully turned it into a two-way street!On the eve of March 31, many guests woke up to a whammy as the staff hurriedly vacated minibars and storage rooms of all alcoholic beverages. While some had an axe to grind, others wiggled out of the way with their wit. To avoid the ban, Punjab changed the National Highway status of its roads to state highway. Quick-witted action, isn’t it?Well, Gurgaon’s CyberHub turned out to be a little more clever. It changed its entrance to the front side to show that the entry is 1.2km away from the highway. Master plan for no ban, indeed! Another bar — Aishwarya restobar on NH 17 — has created a maze of around 300m to increase its distance from the highway. And reportedly, it spent a whopping Rs2 lakhs to construct the route.Think about the best 24×7 hot spots to hangout near Delhi-NCR, and Murthal definitely comes to mind. Can you still down a bottle there? “We don’t serve alcohol in our dhaba,” Prince from Gulshan Dhaba at Murthal told indianexpress.com. Not one to mince words, he was quick to add, “But you can get it at a short distance from this location. Abhi ke liye band hai, aur openly nahi bechenge… par koi baahar se aayega toh mangwa denge (It’s closed for now, but we can arrange alcohol).” He also disclosed that wine shops are not on the highway, but have been shifted to the inner lanes.Another dhaba on the Jaipur-Delhi highway that serves North Indian delicacies till 3am had a similar story. When we called the dhaba and asked if alcohol is served, the person manning the phone, who refused to identify himself, gave a clear sign of no. But once probed, he said, “We can rack up a bottle or two if needed.” Ask him how he would arrange it, and pat came the reply, “Wo humaari tension hai!” The anonymous person even disconnected the phone when he was told we’re from the indianexpress.com.As ridiculous as it may sound, a few bar-cum-restaurants are hiding the word “bar” by covering the signboard with a newspaper. Yes, it actually happened on the Western Express Highway near Mumbai. See how Delite Restaurant & Bar did it.No, that’s not the only one. Gypsy Restaurant & Bar did exactly the same thing. We wonder if they planned it together. Can’t believe it? We have proof!Meanwhile, some restaurants stuck to the rule book. In total disapproval, Saurabh Gulati from Mayur Dhaba in Haryana told indianexpress.com: “We cannot serve alcohol now. Haven’t you heard of the liquor ban?” When asked if he could arrange it, he shook his head and said, “We can’t get alcohol. Koi agar wine pee raha hota hai toh bhi hum allow nahi karte.”Is there any checking going on? “Not really,” he said, “But there are cameras installed at some places which can tell if alcohol is being served.” However, Rajendar Kumar from Harsh Hotel and Restaurant sounded a little shaky about it and told indianexpress.com that he doesn’t know if there is anyone to monitor it. “Ours is a family dhaba. So, we do not allow alcohol. But, there are some dhabas for truck drivers where alcohol is still served,” he divulged.With such interesting insights near the highway, we can’t help but laugh at the jugaad — that comes naturally to most of us Indians! The ban may be a wonderful step to put an end to the life threatening menace of drunken driving. But, sadly enough, good policies cannot hold the cards with a poor implementation.For the rest… till the liquor taps stay shut, unhappy hours are on!"

We wonder if they planned it together. Can’t believe it? We have proof!Meanwhile, some restaurants stuck to the rule book. In total disapproval, Saurabh Gulati from Mayur Dhaba in Haryana told indianexpress.com: “We cannot serve alcohol now. Haven’t you heard of the liquor ban?” When asked if he could arrange it, he shook his head and said, “We can’t get alcohol. Koi agar wine pee raha hota hai toh bhi hum allow nahi karte.”Is there any checking going on? “Not really,” he said, “But there are cameras installed at some places which can tell if alcohol is being served.” However, Rajendar Kumar from Harsh Hotel and Restaurant sounded a little shaky about it and told indianexpress.com that he doesn’t know if there is anyone to monitor it. “Ours is a family dhaba. So, we do not allow alcohol. But, there are some dhabas for truck drivers where alcohol is still served,” he divulged.With such interesting insights near the highway, we can’t help but laugh at the jugaad — that comes naturally to most of us Indians! The ban may be a wonderful step to put an end to the life threatening menace of drunken driving. But, sadly enough, good policies cannot hold the cards with a poor implementation.For the rest… till the liquor taps stay shut, unhappy hours are on!"

			Stanford swimmer Brock Turner case judge to make another sex-crime ruling		",AP,AP,"Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky has faced harsh criticism or the light sentence given to a Stanford University swimmer, Brock Turner, for sexually assaulting a woman. A California judge is set to make his first key decision in a sex crime case since receiving harsh criticism for the light sentence given to a Stanford University swimmer for sexually assaulting a woman who was passed out.Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky said last year he would be ‘receptive’ to Robert Chain’s request to reduce his conviction for possessing child pornography from a felony to a misdemeanor, if the San Jose plumber stayed sober and out of trouble. Persky previously sentenced Chain to four days in jail and ordered him to register as a sex offender. Assistant District Attorney Terry Harman said prosecutors accepted Chain’s short jail sentence and didn’t object to it because “we were satisfied with the felony plea and sex registration in light of the defendant’s remorse and admission of guilt.”Harman said prosecutors will urge Persky to keep the felony conviction when it’s considered at a hearing on Aug. 25. Either way, Chain will remain a registered sex offender. Persky is the target of a recall campaign that started in June after he followed a recommendation by the county probation department and sentenced former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, 20, to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman who passed out behind a trash bin near a fraternity house hosting a party.Turner could have faced up to 14 years behind bars. The 23-year-old victim read an impassioned statement at the sentencing hearing. She described the assault in graphic detail and said her “independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition.” Persky has not commented on Turner’s sentence and did return calls seeking comment on Chain’s case. A judge since 2003, Persky has a history of sparing first-time offenders such as Turner and Chain lengthy prison sentences when he’s convinced counseling and court monitoring can help them get back on track. Critics seeking to oust him from the bench are seizing on the sentence given to Chain as another example of the judge’s leniency toward sex offenders, especially those with enough resources to hire private attorneys.Watch Video: What’s making news They say they examined 14 other Santa Clara County child porn possession cases similar to Chain’s since 2012 and found the judges sentenced defendants to at least six months in jail. “We believe that this is further evidence that Judge Persky exhibits bias in cases of sex crimes,” said campaign chair Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor who is friends of Turner’s victim. Persky “does not appear to understand or correctly weigh the harm caused by these serious crimes and treats them as if they are minor misdemeanors.”Chain was arrested in May 2014 after a San Jose sex crimes investigator remotely watched his computer download child porn images. About 30 images were found on Chain’s electronic devices, including one involving an infant. His privately retained attorney, Brian Madden, said reducing Chain’s conviction to a misdemeanor will make it easier for the 48-year-old to find future employment, housing and financing because a felony conviction would appear during background checks.Madden said Chain battled alcoholism and his life has changed markedly since the arrest. His wife left him with their two young daughters and he’s stayed sober, dutifully attending Alcoholic Anonymous meetings and counseling sessions. He’s taken responsibility for the crime and is remorseful, Madden said.“He has worked hard,” Madden said."

			Delhi Police Diary: For cops struggling with alcoholism, a special class on Saturdays		",Alok Singh,New Delhi | ,"The classes, held Saturday nights, will also help policemen deal better with cases involving alcoholics, said senior police officials. In a first of its kind step, Delhi Police have started organising deaddiction programmes across police districts, in association with Alcoholics Anonymous, to help personnel struggling with alcoholism. Officials from all ranks and posts have been urged to join such sessions, where ‘motivational’ classes will be addressed by trained professionals from Alcoholics Anonymous.“At least six police districts have been covered in the programme. We will cover the other police districts and units in the coming months,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police and Principal at Police Training School (Dwarka) Suman Nalwa. The entire area under Delhi Police’s jurisdiction is divided into 11 districts. The police force has a strength of 85,000 personnel. The classes, held Saturday nights, will also help policemen deal better with cases involving alcoholics, said senior police officials.“Our objective is not only to free our men of alcoholism… but to also work towards an alcohol-free society. In most areas in the capital, alcohol is the cause of many heinous crimes. Despite being aware of this, many police officers don’t know how to deal with alcoholics. These classes will help them learn techniques to deal with such cases and tell people about the evils of alcoholism,” said Nalwa.She added that some of the trainers in the programme are recovering alcoholics themselves. “They are sharing their experiences with our police personnel to help them cope with the problem,” said Nalwa. While junior police officials and sub-inspectors have started attending the classes, senior officers have also been asked to attend them, said sources."

			Church with ‘futuristic’ architecture dates back to the Portuguese era		",Ruhi Bhasin,Mumbai | ,"Our Lady of Salvation Church in Dadar was redesigned by Charles Correa, has skylight by M F Husain.For most of us, the word ‘church’ conjures up images of towers and shingled roofs. The flat, shell-roofed Our Lady of Salvation Church, amid the bustling streets of Dadar, could not be more different. Yet, for all its modern architecture, the church is one of Mumbai’s oldest. Built more than 400 years ago, it was redesigned by celebrated architect Charles Correa in the 1970s.The heavy rain over the past few days has uprooted a 90-year-old tree. As it finally fell after standing tall for years, it damaged the parapet towards the entry. Repairs are on as some people sit inside and pray, oblivious to the sounds outside the cocoon of the church. Popularly known as the Portuguese Church, the building’s shell roofs are ventilated at the top. The skylight in the baptistery is by noted Indian artist M F Husain.The church and parish of Our Lady of Salvation has a history extending over 400 years. It was one of the early churches in the island of Bombay, built by the Portuguese Franciscan Missionaries sometime between 1595 and 1610. It was rebuilt as a larger church in 1651.[related-post]Watch Video: What’s making news According to Joseph D’souza, who works in the administration of the church, one of the murals painted by a foreigner — which has Adam and Eve painted on the two ends — has been covered with curtains, with only the portions depicting Mother Mary and baby Christ visible now. “The regular church-goers did not appreciate the depiction of Adam and Eve, and so we covered that part a few years ago,” he says.It wasn’t just the mural that was put to question. When Correa first remodelled it, the church design was much debated, though now many consider it a landmark. The funeral mass of Correa also took place here in 2015.A write-up on its history provided by the church states, “The controversial church constructed by an architect of international repute has evoked mixed reactions….Somebody once described it as a futuristic Church…..The church is essentially a house of prayer. The high massive wall of random rubble is meant to isolate it from the din and bustle of the outside world within which the worshippers can commune with God in silence.”Explaining the concept behind the architecture of the church, the website of Charles Correa Associates says that the church consists of a series of interlinked spaces, some covered and others open to the sky. The shell roofs are ventilated at the top, thus setting up continuous convection currents of air. “The areas are functionally differentiated in an analogue of Christ’s life.First the year of preparation, secondly the years of public life and finally death and resurrection,” it states.While the design might have meant to keep the church naturally ventilated, Father Bartol D Machado, Parish Priest, says ventilation is now a problem, with people complaining about the heat inside, especially in May. “Installing an air-conditioner is also not possible,” he says. However, he adds, “The architecture was Correa’s way of creating something new. We may not understand it as we are not experts. But we have to take his ideas into consideration.”Conservation architect Abha Lambah feels that the building is a stunning modern landmark. “It challenges the traditional notions of Gothic churches. It has a very bold, exposed concrete exterior, minus the plastering we are used to, and allows a volume of light in naturally,” she says.Housing a medical centre, a fitness centre, an Alcoholics Anonymous facility and a separate help group for the spouses of alcoholics, the structure challenges the conventional idea of what a church looks like and leaves a lasting impression on any visitor."
